## Outline

Motor apparatus and resulting motor control space huge and highly complex (see [Motor Apparats]({% link docs/MotorApparatus/motorapparatus.md %}))

additionally, abundant dof/motor configuration options and redundant control parameters (see [Motor Apparats]({% link docs/ControlTheory/ControlTheory.md %}))

organising into autonomous subunits both simplifies control space and allows for asynchronous motor planning and prediction

hierarchichal organization of nervous system results in specific organisational features and resulting mechanisms [^1]



## General Considerations

to accurately model how this results in emergent complex adaptive behavior, need to understand both the independent organisation of subunits as well as interaction

## Unresolved Questions
