## Cerebellar Cortex

## Cerebellar Nuclei

# New Insights

## Structural Features of the Cerebellum

cortico-cerebellar connections form microcomplexes of parallel closed loops - 

Zebrin zones - long term potentiation/depression - bidirectional learning [^1]

## Functional Features of the Cerebellum


different microzones encode different reward related signals [^2]

role of granular layer


# Open Questions

What do cerebellar signals encode? in which space?

how does timing of IO-Cerebellar interaction influence learning

What is the role of the divergence of nuclei and IO signalling in multimodel info integration?
