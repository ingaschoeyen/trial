## Midbrain

### Red Nucleus

Origin of the rubrospinal tract

receives input from cerebellar nuclei, cerebral cortex, [^basile]

## Tectum

## Tegmentum

## Pons

## Medulla

### Inferior Olive

*below information are established findings taken from [^loyola]

The inferior olivary nuclei, or inferior olive, is a cluster of nuclei in the medulla that exclusively provide the climbing fibres that induce the complex spike in the cerebellar cortex.
The nuclei include the posterior, dorsal

Specific cellular properties of the inferior olivary neurons include the tight gap junctions that induce some degree of synchronisation to the IO output. 

Characteristic neuronal dynamics include the subthreshold oscillations which are summed and carried over in the climbing fiber output and might encode additional spatio-temporal information. 

Recent Findings:

IO signal could encode more than error signal, also risk, reward [^larry], and salience [^bina].

Input to IO is largely convergent

IO neurons respond to broad class of sensory input 

IO CF input to cerebellar cortex gives structural division into microcircuits that are preserved across the entire loop of granular layer, purkinje cell layer, deep cerebellar nuclei, and projections to cortex and subcortical targets, forming parallel closed loops, could represent the cerebellar unit circuit. [^zeeuw1]

### Lateral Reticular Formation

Source of the reticulospinal tract

premotor center, associated with locomotion, posture and more, provides driving signal to spinal interneuron centers and propriospinal interneurons [^alstermark].

can be losely grouped into parvocellular and gigantocellular section

gigantocellular neurons implicated in initiation and driving of locomotion [^lemieux]

### Dorsal Spinal Nucleus
