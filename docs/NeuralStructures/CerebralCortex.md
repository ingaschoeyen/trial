## Frontal Cortex

### M1

## Parietal Cortex

rostro-caudal axis of state representation in PPC from environment-projected-on-body to body-projected-on-environment [^1]

matches connectivity with connectivity of external vs proprioceptvie modalities, respectively [^2]

### S1

## Occipital Cortex

## Networks

### Mirror Neuron System

recently found, mirror neuron system emerges from simple hebbian learning rule model [^3]
