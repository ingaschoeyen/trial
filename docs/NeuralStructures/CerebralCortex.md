# The Cerebral Cortex

## Cortical subregions and functions

### Sensorimotor cortex

The sensorimotor cortex, commonly divided into m1 and s1 

Reciprocal connections between s1 and m1 allow for direct integration of sensory feedback.

Additionally, s1 differenatially modulated hemispheric m1 activity, one possible mechanism for whole body integration of motor plans focussed on single limbs [^edwards]

### Cingulate Cortex

### Frontal Cortex

### Temporal Cortex

## Cortical Networks
