# Overview

Many basic motor behaviors are organised by parallel motor loops that can act autonomously while also allowing for top-down modulation.

In this review, the focus will be put on oculomotor loops, locomotor loops and manual, ie. upper limb and hand motor loops.

Often, these three have to coregulate each other to best achieve a goal. 

For example, consider hitting a tennis ball: this goal consists of independent basic tasks, such as adjusting the eye and head position to follow the ball, lifting, holding, and swinging the racket, all while maintaining a stable posture.
Additionally, the motor loops ahve to share information, e.g. orient the racket with respect to the ball based on visual feedback, adjust the body posture based on the changing arm position and force demands, ...
