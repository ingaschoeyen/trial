		"abstract": "The neural mechanisms that generate an extensible library of motor motifs and flexibly string them into arbitrary sequences are unclear. We developed a model in which inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons project to thalamic units that are themselves bidirectionally connected to a recurrent cortical network. We model the basal ganglia inhibitory patterns as silencing some thalamic neurons while leaving others disinhibited and free to interact with cortex during specific motifs. We show that a small number of disinhibited thalamic neurons can control cortical dynamics to generate specific motor output in a noise-robust way. Additionally, a single “preparatory” thalamocortical network can produce fast cortical dynamics that support rapid transitions between any pair of learned motifs. If the thalamic units associated with each sequence component are segregated, many motor outputs can be learned without interference and then combined in arbitrary orders for the flexible production of long and complex motor sequences.",

		"abstract": "The lateral reticular nucleus (LRN) is a major precerebellar centre of mossy fibre information to the cerebellum from the spinal cord that is distinct from the direct spinocerebellar paths. The LRN has traditionally been considered to provide the cerebellum with segregated information from several spinal systems controlling posture, reaching, grasping, locomotion, scratching and respiration. However, results are presented that show extensive convergence on a majority of LRN neurons from spinal systems. We propose a new hypothesis suggesting that the LRN may use extensive convergence from the different input systems to provide overview and integration of linked motor components to the cerebellum. This integrated information is sent in parallel with the segregated information from the individual systems to the cerebellum that finally may compare the activity and make necessary adjustments of various motor behaviours.",

	"abstract": "Investigation of natural behavior has contributed a number of insights to our understanding of visual guidance of actions by highlighting the importance of behavioral goals and focusing attention on how vision and action play out in time. In this context, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and the role of vision is to provide the relevant information for making good decisions in order to achieve those goals. This conceptualization of visually guided actions as a sequence of sensory-motor decisions has been formalized within the framework of statistical decision theory, which structures the problem and provides the context for much recent progress in vision and action. Components of a good decision include the task, which defines the behavioral goals, the rewards and costs associated with those goals, uncertainty about the state of the world, and prior knowledge.",

	"abstract": "One of the functions of the cerebellum in motor learning is to predict and account for systematic changes to the body or environment. This form of adaptive learning is mediated by plastic changes occurring within the cerebellar cortex. The strength of cerebellar-to-cerebral pathways for a given muscle may reflect aspects of cerebellum-dependent motor adaptation. These connections with motor cortex (M1) can be estimated as cerebellar inhibition (CBI): a conditioning pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered to the cerebellum before a test pulse over motor cortex. Previously, we have demonstrated that changes in CBI for a given muscle representation correlate with learning a motor adaptation task with the involved limb. However, the specificity of these effects is unknown. Here, we investigated whether CBI changes in humans are somatotopy specific and how they relate to motor adaptation. We found that learning a visuomotor rotation task with the right hand changed CBI, not only for the involved first dorsal interosseous of the right hand, but also for an uninvolved right leg muscle, the tibialis anterior, likely related to inter-effector transfer of learning. In two follow-up experiments, we investigated whether the preparation of a simple hand or leg movement would produce a somatotopy-specific modulation of CBI. We found that CBI changes only for the effector involved in the movement. These results indicate that learning-related changes in cerebellar–M1 connectivity reflect a somatotopy-specific interaction. Modulation of this pathway is also present in the context of interlimb transfer of learning., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Connectivity between the cerebellum and motor cortex is a critical pathway for the integrity of everyday movements and understanding the somatotopic specificity of this pathway in the context of motor learning is critical to advancing the efficacy of neurorehabilitation. We found that adaptive learning with the hand affects cerebellar–motor cortex connectivity, not only for the trained hand, but also for an untrained leg muscle, an effect likely related to intereffector transfer of learning. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method to measure cerebellar–motor cortex connectivity during movement preparation. With this technique, we show that, outside the context of learning, modulation of cerebellar–motor cortex connectivity is somatotopically specific to the effector being moved.",

		"abstract": "While resting-state fMRI studies have provided a broad picture of the connectivity between human neocortex and cerebellum, the degree of convergence of cortical inputs onto cerebellar circuits remains unknown. Does each cerebellar region receive input from a single cortical area or convergent inputs from multiple cortical areas? Here, we use task-based fMRI data to build a range of cortico-cerebellar connectivity models, each allowing for a different degree of convergence. We compared these models by their ability to predict cerebellar activity patterns for novel Task Sets. Models that allow some degree of convergence provided the best predictions, arguing for convergence of multiple cortical inputs onto single cerebellar voxels. Importantly, the degree of convergence varied across the cerebellum with the highest convergence observed in areas linked to language, working memory, and social cognition. These findings suggest important differences in the way that functional subdivisions of the cerebellum support motor and cognitive function.",

		"abstract": "The function of a feedback inhibitory circuit between cerebellar Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) was defined by combining optogenetics, neuronal activity recordings both in cerebellar slices and in vivo, and computational modeling. Purkinje cells inhibit a subset of MLIs in the inner third of the molecular layer. This inhibition is non-reciprocal, short-range (less than 200 μm) and is based on convergence of one to two Purkinje cells onto MLIs. During learning-related eyelid movements in vivo, the activity of a subset of MLIs progressively increases as Purkinje cell activity decreases, with Purkinje cells usually leading the MLIs. Computer simulations indicate that these relationships are best explained by the feedback circuit from Purkinje cells to MLIs and that this feedback circuit plays a central role in making cerebellar learning efficient.",

		"abstract": "Motor behaviors are often planned long before execution but only released after specific sensory events. Planning and execution are each associated with distinct patterns of motor cortex activity. Key questions are how these dynamic activity patterns are generated and how they relate to behavior. Here, we investigate the multi-regional neural circuits that link an auditory “Go cue” and the transition from planning to execution of directional licking. Ascending glutamatergic neurons in the midbrain reticular and pedunculopontine nuclei show short latency and phasic changes in spike rate that are selective for the Go cue. This signal is transmitted via the thalamus to the motor cortex, where it triggers a rapid reorganization of motor cortex state from planning-related activity to a motor command, which in turn drives appropriate movement. Our studies show how midbrain can control cortical dynamics via the thalamus for rapid and precise motor behavior.",

However, cerebro-cerebellar communication may also be mediated by the olivary climbing fibres via a hub in the mesodiencephalic junction (MDJ). Here, we show that rostromedial and caudal parts of mouse CC predominantly project to the principal olive via the rostroventral MDJ and that more rostrolateral CC regions prominently project to the rostral medial accessory olive via the caudodorsal MDJ. Moreover, transneuronal tracing results show that the cerebellar nuclei innervate the olivary-projecting neurons in the MDJ that receive input from CC, and that they adhere to the same topographical relations. By unravelling these topographic and dense, mono- and disynaptic projections from the CC through the MDJ and inferior olive to the cerebellum, this work establishes that cerebro-cerebellar communication can be mediated by both the mossy fibre and climbing fibre system.",

		"abstract": "Due to the uniform cyto-architecture of the cerebellar cortex, its overall physiological characteristics have traditionally been considered to be homogeneous. In this study, we show in awake mice at rest that spiking activity of Purkinje cells, the sole output cells of the cerebellar cortex, differs between cerebellar modules and correlates with their expression of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C or zebrin. Simple spike and complex spike frequencies were significantly higher in Purkinje cells located in zebrin-negative than zebrin-positive modules. The difference in simple spike frequency persisted when the synaptic input to, but not intrinsic activity of, Purkinje cells was manipulated. Blocking TRPC3, the effector channel of a cascade of proteins that have zebrin-like distribution patterns, attenuated the simple spike frequency difference. Our results indicate that zebrin-discriminated cerebellar modules operate at different frequencies, which depend on activation of TRPC3, and that this property is relevant for all cerebellar functions.",

		"abstract": "Elaborate behaviours are produced by tightly controlled flexor-extensor motor neuron activation patterns. Motor neurons are regulated by a network of interneurons within the spinal cord, but the computational processes involved in motor control are not fully understood. The neuroanatomical arrangement of motor and premotor neurons into topographic patterns related to their controlled muscles is thought to facilitate how information is processed by spinal circuits. Rabies retrograde monosynaptic tracing has been used to label premotor interneurons innervating specific motor neuron pools, with previous studies reporting topographic mediolateral positional biases in flexor and extensor premotor interneurons. To more precisely define how premotor interneurons contacting specific motor pools are organized, we used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice to minimize systematic biases associated with each method. Contrary to expectations, we found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains like motor neurons. Thus, premotor spinal neurons controlling different muscles process motor instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components.",

		"abstract": "Over the past 30 years, cumulative evidence has indicated that cerebellar function extends beyond sensorimotor control. This view has emerged from studies of neuroanatomy, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and brain stimulation, with the results implicating the cerebellum in domains as diverse as attention, language, executive function, and social cognition. Although the literature provides sophisticated models of how the cerebellum helps refine movements, it remains unclear how the core mechanisms of these models can be applied when considering a broader conceptualization of cerebellar function. In light of recent multidisciplinary findings, we examine how two key concepts that have been suggested as general computational principles of cerebellar function- prediction and error-based learning- might be relevant in the operation of cognitive cerebro-cerebellar loops.",

		"abstract": "Predicting upcoming sensorimotor events means creating forward estimates of the body and the surrounding world. This ability is a fundamental aspect of skilled motor behavior and requires an accurate and constantly updated representation of the body and the environment. To test whether these prediction mechanisms could be affected by a peripheral injury, we employed an action observation and electroencephalogram (EEG) paradigm to assess the occurrence of prediction markers in anticipation of observed sensorimotor events in healthy and brachial plexus injury (BPI) participants. Nine healthy subjects and six BPI patients watched a series of video clips showing an actor's hand and a colored ball in an egocentric perspective. The color of the ball indicated whether the hand would grasp it (hand movement), or the ball would roll toward the hand and touch it (ball movement), or no event would occur (no movement). In healthy participants, we expected to find distinct electroencephalographic activation patterns (EEG signatures) specific to the prediction of the occurrence of each of these situations. Cluster analysis from EEG signals recorded from electrodes placed over the sensorimotor cortex of control participants showed that predicting either an upcoming hand movement or the occurrence of a tactile event yielded specific neural signatures. In BPI participants, the EEG signals from the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the dominant hand in the hand movement condition were different compared to the other conditions. Furthermore, there were no differences between ball movement and no movement conditions in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the dominant hand, suggesting that BPI blurred specifically the ability to predict upcoming tactile events for the dominant hand. These results highlight the role of the sensorimotor cortex in creating estimates of both actions and tactile interactions in the space around the body and suggest plastic effects on prediction coding following peripheral sensorimotor loss.",

		"abstract": "To optimally adjust our behavior to changing environments we need to both adjust the speed of our decisions and movements. Yet little is known about the extent to which these processes are controlled by common or separate mechanisms. Furthermore, while previous evidence from computational models and empirical studies suggests that the basal ganglia play an important role during adjustments of decision-making, it remains unclear how this is implemented. Leveraging the opportunity to directly access the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia in humans undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery, we here combine invasive electrophysiological recordings, electrical stimulation and computational modelling of perceptual decision-making. We demonstrate that, while similarities between subthalamic control of decision- and movement speed exist, the causal contribution of the subthalamic nucleus to these processes can be disentangled. Our results show that the basal ganglia independently control the speed of decisions and movement for each hemisphere during adaptive behavior.",

		"abstract": "The centralization of locomotor control from weak and local coupling to strong and global is hard to assess outside of particular modeling frameworks. We developed an empirical, model-free measure of centralization that compares information between control signals and both global and local states. A second measure, co-information, quantifies the net redundancy in global and local control. We first validate that our measures predict centralization in simulations of phase-coupled oscillators. We then test how centralization changes with speed in freely running cockroaches. Surprisingly, across all speeds centralization is constant and muscle activity is more informative of the global kinematic state (the averages of all legs) than the local state of that muscle’s leg. Finally we use a legged robot to show that mechanical coupling alone can change the centralization of legged locomotion. The results of these systems span a design space of centralization and co-information for biological and robotic systems.",

		"abstract": "Motor cortex (M1) exhibits a rich repertoire of neuronal activities to support the generation of complex movements. Although recent neuronal-network models capture many qualitative aspects of M1 dynamics, they can generate only a few distinct movements. Additionally, it is unclear how M1 efficiently controls movements over a wide range of shapes and speeds. We demonstrate that modulation of neuronal input–output gains in recurrent neuronal-network models with a fixed architecture can dramatically reorganize neuronal activity and thus downstream muscle outputs. Consistent with the observation of diffuse neuromodulatory projections to M1, a relatively small number of modulatory control units provide sufficient flexibility to adjust high-dimensional network activity using a simple reward-based learning rule. Furthermore, it is possible to assemble novel movements from previously learned primitives, and one can separately change movement speed while preserving movement shape. Our results provide a new perspective on the role of modulatory systems in controlling recurrent cortical activity.",

			"abstract": "The smooth conduct of movements requires simultaneous motor planning and execution according to internal goals. So far it remains unknown how such movement plans are modified without interfering with ongoing movements. Previous studies have isolated planning and execution-related neuronal activity by separating behavioral planning and movement periods in time by sensory cues. Here, we separate continuous self-paced motor planning from motor execution statistically, by experimentally minimizing the repetitiveness of the movements. This approach shows that, in the rat sensorimotor cortex, neuronal motor planning processes evolve with slower dynamics than movement-related responses. Fast-evolving neuronal activity precees skilled forelimb movements and is nested within slower dynamics. We capture this effect via high-pass filtering and confirm the results with optogenetic stimulations. The various dynamics combined with adaptation-based high-pass filtering provide a simple principle for separating concurrent motor planning and execution.",

			"abstract": "Although the generation of movements is a fundamental function of the nervous system, the underlying neural principles remain unclear. As flexor and extensor muscle activities alternate during rhythmic movements such as walking, it is often assumed that the responsible neural circuitry is similarly exhibiting alternating activity1. Here we present ensemble recordings of neurons in the lumbar spinal cord that indicate that, rather than alternating, the population is performing a low-dimensional ‘rotation’ in neural space, in which the neural activity is cycling through all phases continuously during the rhythmic behaviour. The radius of rotation correlates with the intended muscle force, and a perturbation of the low-dimensional trajectory can modify the motor behaviour. As existing models of spinal motor control do not offer an adequate explanation of rotation1,2, we propose a theory of neural generation of movements from which this and other unresolved issues, such as speed regulation, force control and multifunctionalism, are readily explained.",

			"abstract": "The hand trajectory of motion during the performance of one-dimensional point-to-point movements has been shown to be marked by motor primitives with a bell-shaped velocity profile. Researchers have investigated if motor primitives with the same shape mark also complex upper-limb movements. They have done so by analyzing the magnitude of the hand trajectory velocity vector. This approach has failed to identify motor primitives with a bell-shaped velocity profile as the basic elements underlying the generation of complex upper-limb movements. In this study, we examined upper-limb movements by analyzing instead the movement components defined according to a Cartesian coordinate system with axes oriented in the medio-lateral, antero-posterior, and vertical directions. To our surprise, we found out that a broad set of complex upper-limb movements can be modeled as a combination of motor primitives with a bell-shaped velocity profile defined according to the axes of the above-defined coordinate system. Most notably, we discovered that these motor primitives scale with the size of movement according to a power law. These results provide a novel key to the interpretation of brain and muscle synergy studies suggesting that human subjects use a scale-invariant encoding of movement patterns when performing upper-limb movements.",

			"abstract": "Walking in our complex environment requires continual higher order integrated spatiotemporal information. This information is processed in the somatosensory cortex, and it has long been presumed that it influences movement via descending tracts originating from the motor cortex. Here we show that neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory cortex tightly correlates with the onset and speed of locomotion in freely moving mice. Using optogenetics and pharmacogenetics in combination with in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, we provide evidence for a direct corticospinal pathway from the primary somatosensory cortex that synapses with cervical excitatory neurons and modulates the lumbar locomotor network independently of the motor cortex and other supraspinal locomotor centers. Stimulation of this pathway enhances speed of locomotion, while inhibition decreases locomotor speed and ultimately terminates stepping. Our findings reveal a novel pathway for neural control of movement whereby the somatosensory cortex directly influences motor behavior, possibly in response to environmental cues.",

			"abstract": "Descending command neurons instruct spinal networks to execute basic locomotor functions, such as gait and speed. The command functions for gait and speed are symmetric, implying that a separate unknown system directs asymmetric movements, including the ability to move left or right. In the present study, we report that Chx10-lineage reticulospinal neurons act to control the direction of locomotor movements in mammals. Chx10 neurons exhibit mainly ipsilateral projection, and their selective unilateral activation causes ipsilateral turning movements in freely moving mice. Unilateral inhibition of Chx10 neurons causes contralateral turning movements. Paired left–right motor recordings identified distinct mechanisms for directional movements mediated via limb and axial spinal circuits. Finally, we identify sensorimotor brain regions that project on to Chx10 reticulospinal neurons, and demonstrate that their unilateral activation can impart left–right directional commands. Together these data identify the descending motor system that commands left–right locomotor asymmetries in mammals.",

			"abstract": "Previous studies indicate that the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) integrates sensorimotor information from cortical and thalamic regions to learn and execute motor habits. However, the exact contribution of sensory representations to this process is still unknown. Here we explore the role of the forelimb somatosensory flow in the DLS during the learning and execution of motor habits. First, we compare rhythmic somesthetic representations in the DLS and primary somatosensory cortex in anesthetized rats, and find that sequential and temporal stimuli contents are more strongly represented in the DLS. Then, using a behavioral protocol in which rats developed a stereotyped motor sequence, functional disconnection experiments, and pharmacologic and optogenetic manipulations in apprentice and expert animals, we reveal that somatosensory thalamic- and cortical-striatal pathways are indispensable for the temporal component of execution. Our results indicate that the somatosensory flow in the DLS provides the temporal reference for the development and execution of motor habits.",

We sought to determine the contribution of primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex to this ability. Monkeys performed highly practiced two-reach sequences, interleaved with matched reaches performed alone or separated by a delay. We partitioned neural population activity into components pertaining to preparation, initiation and execution. The hypothesis that movement elements fuse makes specific predictions regarding all three forms of activity. We observed none of these predicted effects. Rapid two-reach sequences involved the same set of neural events as individual reaches but with preparation for the second reach occurring as the first was in flight. Thus, at the level of dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex, skillfully executing a rapid sequence depends not on fusing elements, but on the ability to perform two key processes at the same time.",

			"abstract": "Humans walk and run, as well as change their gait speed, through the control of their complicated and redundant musculoskeletal system. These gaits exhibit different locomotor behaviors, such as a double-stance phase in walking and flight phase in running. The complex and redundant nature of the musculoskeletal system and the wide variation in locomotion characteristics lead us to imagine that the motor control strategies for these gaits, which remain unclear, are extremely complex and differ from one another. It has been previously proposed that muscle activations may be generated by linearly combining a small set of basic pulses produced by central pattern generators (muscle synergy hypothesis). This control scheme is simple and thought to be shared between walking and running at different speeds. Demonstrating that this control scheme can generate walking and running and change the speed is critical, as bipedal locomotion is dynamically challenging. Here, we provide such a demonstration by using a motor control model with 69 parameters developed based on the muscle synergy hypothesis. Specifically, we show that it produces both walking and running of a human musculoskeletal model by changing only seven key motor control parameters. Furthermore, we show that the model can walk and run at different speeds by changing only the same seven parameters based on the desired speed. These findings will improve our understanding of human motor control in locomotion and provide guiding principles for the control design of wearable exoskeletons and prostheses.",

			"abstract": "Voluntary movement requires communication from cortex to the spinal cord, where a dedicated pool of motor units (MUs) activates each muscle. The canonical description of MU function rests upon two foundational tenets. First, cortex cannot control MUs independently but supplies each pool with a common drive. Second, MUs are recruited in a rigid fashion that largely accords with Henneman’s size principle. Although this paradigm has considerable empirical support, a direct test requires simultaneous observations of many MUs across diverse force profiles. In this study, we developed an isometric task that allowed stable MU recordings, in a rhesus macaque, even during rapidly changing forces. Patterns of MU activity were surprisingly behavior-dependent and could be accurately described only by assuming multiple drives. Consistent with flexible descending control, microstimulation of neighboring cortical sites recruited different MUs. Furthermore, the cortical population response displayed sufficient degrees of freedom to potentially exert fine-grained control. Thus, MU activity is flexibly controlled to meet task demands, and cortex may contribute to this ability.",

			"abstract": "Hybrid kinetic and kinematic intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) have the potential to restore functional grasping and object interaction capabilities in individuals with tetraplegia. This requires an understanding of how kinetic information is represented in neural activity, and how this representation is affected by non-motor parameters such as volitional state (VoS), namely, whether one observes, imagines, or attempts an action. To this end, this work investigates how motor cortical neural activity changes when three human participants with tetraplegia observe, imagine, and attempt to produce three discrete hand grasping forces with the dominant hand. We show that force representation follows the same VoS-related trends as previously shown for directional arm movements; namely, that attempted force production recruits more neural activity compared to observed or imagined force production. Additionally, VoS-modulated neural activity to a greater extent than grasping force. Neural representation of forces was lower than expected, possibly due to compromised somatosensory pathways in individuals with tetraplegia, which have been shown to influence motor cortical activity. Nevertheless, attempted forces (but not always observed or imagined forces) could be decoded significantly above chance, thereby potentially providing relevant information towards the development of a hybrid kinetic and kinematic iBCI.",

			"abstract": "Motor synergies are neural organizations of a set of redundant motor effectors that interact with one another to compensate for each other’s error and ensure the stabilization of a performance variable. Recent studies have demonstrated that central nervous system synergistically coordinates its numerous motor effectors through Bayesian multi-sensory integration. Deficiency in sensory synergy weakens the synergistic interaction between the motor effectors. Here, we scrutinize the neuromechanical mechanism underlying this phenomenon through spectral analysis and modeling. We validate our model-generated results using experimental data reported in the literature collected from participants performing a finger force production task with and without tactile feedback (manipulated through injection of anesthetic in fingers). Spectral analysis reveals that the error compensation feature of synergies occurs only at low frequencies. Modeling suggests that the neurophysiological structures involving short-latency back-coupling loops similar to the well-known Renshaw cells explain the deterioration of synergy due to sensory deprivation.",

Here, the size of the eye velocity in the initiation of smooth eye movements in the right panel depends on whether a cerebellar Purkinje cell discharges 3 (red), 4 (green), 5 (blue), or 6 (black) spikes in the 40-ms window indicated by the gray shading in the rasters on the left.\n\nSpike trains are rich in information that can be extracted to guide behaviors at millisecond time resolution or across longer time intervals. In sensory systems, the information usually is defined with respect to the stimulus. Especially in motor systems, however, it is equally critical to understand how spike trains predict behavior. Thus, our goal was to compare systematically spike trains in the oculomotor system with eye movement behavior on single movements. We analyzed the discharge of Purkinje cells in the floccular complex of the cerebellum, floccular target neurons in the brainstem, other vestibular neurons, and abducens neurons. We find that an extra spike in a brief analysis window predicts a substantial fraction of the trial-by-trial variation in the initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements. For Purkinje cells, a single extra spike in a 40 ms analysis window predicts, on average, 0.5 SDs of the variation in behavior. An optimal linear estimator predicts behavioral variation slightly better than do spike counts in brief windows. Simulations reveal that the ability of single spikes to predict a fraction of behavior also emerges from model spike trains that have the same statistics as the real spike trains, as long as they are driven by shared sensory inputs. We think that the shared sensory estimates in their inputs create correlations in neural spiking across time and across each population. As a result, one or a small number of spikes in a brief time interval can predict a substantial fraction of behavioral variation.",

			"abstract": "Aversive motivation plays a prominent role in driving individuals to exert cognitive control. However, the complexity of behavioral responses attributed to aversive incentives creates significant challenges for developing a clear understanding of the neural mechanisms of this motivation-control interaction. We review the animal learning, systems neuroscience, and computational literatures to highlight the importance of experimental paradigms that incorporate both motivational context manipulations and mixed motivational components (e.g., bundling of appetitive and aversive incentives). Specifically, we postulate that to understand aversive incentive effects on cognitive control allocation, a critical contextual factor is whether such incentives are associated with negative reinforcement or punishment. We further illustrate how the inclusion of mixed motivational components in experimental paradigms enables increased precision in the measurement of aversive influences on cognitive control. A sharpened experimental and theoretical focus regarding the manipulation and assessment of distinct motivational dimensions promises to advance understanding of the neural, monoaminergic, and computational mechanisms that underlie the interaction of motivation and cognitive control.",

This improves the robot stability and smoothness while locomoting. We apply nonlinear oscillators to model Central Pattern Generators (CPGs). These generate the rhythmic locomotor movements for a quadruped robot. The generated trajectories are modulated by a tonic signal, that encodes the required activity and/or modulation. This drive signal strength is mapped onto sets of CPG parameters. By increasing the drive signal, locomotion can be elicited and velocity increased while switching to the appropriate gaits. This drive signal can be specified according to sensory information or set a priori. The system is implemented in a simulated and real AIBO robot. Results demonstrate the adequacy of the architecture to generate and modulate the required coordinated trajectories according to a velocity increase; and to smoothly and easily switch among the different motor behaviors.",

			"abstract": "The involvement of the reticular formation (RF) in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive information has been extensively studied. The brainstem RF contains several areas which are targeted by spinal cord afferents conveying nociceptive input. The arrival of nociceptive input to the RF may trigger alert reactions which generate a protective/defense reaction to pain. RF neurons located at the medulla oblongata and targeted by ascending nociceptive information are also involved in the control of vital functions that can be affected by pain, namely cardiovascular control. The RF contains centers that belong to the pain modulatory system, namely areas involved in bidirectional balance (decrease or enhancement) of pain responses. It is currently accepted that the imbalance of pain modulation towards pain facilitation accounts for chronic pain. The medullary RF has the peculiarity of harboring areas involved in bidirectional pain control namely by the existence of specific neuronal populations involved in antinociceptive or pronociceptive behavioral responses, namely at the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) and the caudal ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Furthermore the dorsal reticular nucleus (also known as subnucleus reticularis dorsalis; DRt) may enhance nociceptive responses, through a reverberative circuit established with spinal lamina I neurons and inhibit wide-dynamic range (WDR) neurons of the deep dorsal horn. The components of the triad RVM-VLM-DRt are reciprocally connected and represent a key gateway for top-down pain modulation. The RVM-VLM-DRt triad also represents the neurobiological substrate for the emotional and cognitive modulation of pain, through pathways that involve the periaqueductal gray (PAG)-RVM connection. Collectively, we propose that the RVM-VLM-DRt triad represents a key component of the “dynamic pain connectome” with special features to provide integrated and rapid responses in situations which are life-threatening and involve pain. The new available techniques in neurobiological studies both in animal and human studies are producing new and fascinating data which allow to understand the complex role of the RF in pain modulation and its integration with several body functions and also how the RF accounts for chronic pain.",

			"abstract": "Some major trends in the evolution of vertebrate motor systems are illustrated by examples taken from studies of the reticulospinal pathways. Using the tools of modern systematic zoology, we try to determine whether certain features of these complex motor systems represent shared primitive characters, arrived at early in evolution, or whether they represent shared derived characters, which have arisen more recently. Several hypotheses are proposed in a manner which makes them testable and which suggests directions for future studies of reticulospinal systems. Recent evidence illustrates that reticulospinal systems are equally complex in a wide variety of vertebrates, not only mammals. Have these complex systems evolved independently several times or only once in vertebrate phylogeny? For purposes of illustration, we take two medullary reticular nuclei, reticularis (r.) gigantocellularis and r. magnocellularis of mammals (or r. inferioris pars ventralis and r. ventrolateralis of reptiles), and analyze their distribution, first in various vertebrate taxa and then within various families of the repitilian suborder Lacertilia (lizards and snakes). The evidence is strong that both of these nuclei are primitive characters for amniotes and we hypothesize that they are primitive for all vertebrates. The second nucleus, Rmc/RVL, shows considerable variability in appearance within one major taxon where it has been carefully studied, the Reptilia. We suggest that it should be studied in a wider variety of species within other classes. Among several possible functions for this nucleus, one of the most prominent (in mammals, at least) and seemingly basic (e.g., widely useful) is a role in mediating pain at spinal levels. Why then would its presence among the reptiles be so erratic?",

			"abstract": "As an essential component of ascending activating systems, cholinergic neurons with diffuse projections are supposed to be involved in the regulation of cognitive processes such as attention, consciousness, learning, and memory. As for the role of cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain nuclei to cerebral cortical regions including hippocampus, a couple of models have been proposed that acetylcholine facilitates extrinsic inputs to the cortex and inhibits intracortical processing. In this review, to explore the possibility that there exists a generalized principle on the role of cholinergic systems in the brain, we summarized the knowledge so far obtained on the action of a brainstem cholinergic nucleus, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTN) at their target regions. By in vitro experiments we clarified that cholinergic inputs to the intermediate layer of the superior colliculus, presumably originating from the PPTN, facilitate generation of its motor outputs for the initiation of saccades. Furthermore, cholinergic inputs may enhance excitatory responses of mesopontine dopaminergic cells, for instance to reward-related signals. In addition, we observed that PPTN neurons showed multi-modal activities in behaving monkeys; their activities were related to execution and preparation of saccades, the level of task performance, and reward. The multi-modal activities encoded in the PPTN may suggest that PPTN associates movement-related activities with those related to task performance and reward. Together with the already reported facilitatory action on the sensory processing at the visual thalamus, these observations suggest that the brainstem cholinergic system facilitates the central processes for motor command generation and extrinsic sensory processing. For our final goal of exploring the general working principle of the cholinergic systems, further studies are needed to clarify the effects of the brainstem cholinergic system on the intrinsic processing in the brain.",

			"abstract": "There is a close relationship between progress in learning and the error-monitoring system. EEG and fMRI studies using probabilistic learning have revealed the distinct dynamics of this system after response and feedback, i.e. an increase of error-related and a decrease of feedback-related activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Based on the existing theories, it can be presumed that during deterministic learning feedback-related activity in ACC would also increase. Since these assumptions have not yet been confirmed, it can be only speculated based on the data from the probabilistic paradigms how the information is being integrated within the ACC during deterministic learning. Here we implemented the Paired Associate Deterministic Learning task to the EEG and fMRI experiments. The analysis of EEG data showed a significant increase in the amplitude for both ERN and FN. Similarly, the fMRI results showed an increase in response-related and feedback-related activity of the ACC in erroneous trials. Our findings are in line with the current theories of ACC function: increasing ACC activity can be linked to the detected discrepancy between expected and obtained outcomes. We argue that expectancy violations in the course of deterministic learning are signalled by both, internal and external evaluation system.",

			"abstract": "In the present study we evaluated changes in neural activation that occur over the time course of multiple days of sensorimotor adaptation, and identified individual neural predictors of adaptation and savings magnitude. We collected functional MRI data while participants performed a manual adaptation task during four separate test sessions over a three-month period. This allowed us to examine changes in activation and associations with adaptation and savings at subsequent sessions. Participants exhibited reliable savings of adaptation across the four sessions. Brain activity associated with early adaptation increased across the sessions in a variety of frontal, parietal, cingulate, and temporal cortical areas, as well as various subcortical areas. We found that savings was positively associated with activation in several striatal, parietal, and cingulate cortical areas including the putamen, precuneus, angular gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and cingulate motor area. These findings suggest that participants may learn how to better engage cognitive processes across days, potentially reflecting improvements in action selection. We propose that such improvements may rely on action-value assignments, which previously have been linked to the dACC and striatum. As correct movements are assigned a higher value than incorrect movements, the former are more likely to be performed again.",

			"abstract": "Learning occurs when an outcome differs from expectations, generating a reward prediction error signal (RPE). The RPE signal has been hypothesized to simultaneously embody the valence of an outcome (better or worse than expected) and its surprise (how far from expectations). Nonetheless, growing evidence suggests that separate representations of the two RPE components exist in the human brain. Meta-analyses provide an opportunity to test this hypothesis and directly probe the extent to which the valence and surprise of the error signal are encoded in separate or overlapping networks. We carried out several meta-analyses on a large set of fMRI studies investigating the neural basis of RPE, locked at decision outcome. We identified two valence learning systems by pooling studies searching for differential neural activity in response to categorical positive-versus-negative outcomes. The first valence network (negative > positive) involved areas regulating alertness and switching behaviours such as the midcingulate cortex, the thalamus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex whereas the second valence network (positive > negative) encompassed regions of the human reward circuitry such as the ventral striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We also found evidence of a largely distinct surprise-encoding network including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and dorsal striatum. Together with recent animal and electrophysiological evidence this meta-analysis points to a sequential and distributed encoding of different components of the RPE signal, with potentially distinct functional roles.",

			"abstract": "Unexpected events are part of everyday experience. They come in several varieties-action errors, unexpected action outcomes, and unexpected perceptual events-and they lead to motor slowing and cognitive distraction. While different varieties of unexpected events have been studied largely independently, and many different mechanisms are thought to explain their effects on action and cognition, we suggest a unifying theory. We propose that unexpected events recruit a fronto-basal-ganglia network for stopping. This network includes specific prefrontal cortical nodes and is posited to project to the subthalamic nucleus, with a putative global suppressive effect on basal-ganglia output. We argue that unexpected events interrupt action and impact cognition, partly at least, by recruiting this global suppressive network. This provides a common mechanistic basis for different types of unexpected events; links the literatures on motor inhibition, performance monitoring, attention, and working memory; and is relevant for understanding clinical symptoms of distractibility and mental inflexibility.",

However, in humans and other species learning often takes place by observing other individuals. Here, we show that, when humans observe other players in a card game, neurons in their rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) encode both the expected value of an observed choice, and the PE after the outcome was revealed. Notably, during the same task neurons recorded in the amygdala (AMY) and the rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) do not exhibit this type of encoding. Our results suggest that humans learn by observing others, at least in part through the encoding of observational PEs in single neurons in the rACC.",

The ability to form an association between an initially possibly neutral sensory stimulus and its behavioral relevance is essential for our ability to navigate in a changing environment. The formation of a memory is a complex process involving many areas of the brain. In this chapter we review classic and recent work that has shed light on the specific contribution of sensory cortical areas to the formation of associative memories. We discuss synaptic and circuit mechanisms that mediate plastic adaptations of functional properties in individual neurons as well as larger neuronal populations forming topographically organized representations. Furthermore, we describe commonly used behavioral paradigms that are used to study the mechanisms of memory formation. We focus on the auditory modality that is receiving increasing attention for the study of associative memory in rodent model systems. We argue that sensory cortical areas may play an important role for the memory-dependent categorical recognition of previously encountered sensory stimuli.",

			"abstract": "Many physiological and pathological changes in brain function manifest in eye-movement control. As such, assessment of oculomotion is an invaluable part of a clinical examination and affords a non-invasive window on several key aspects of neuronal computation. While oculomotion is often used to detect deficits of the sort associated with vascular or neoplastic events; subtler (e.g. pharmacological) effects on neuronal processing also induce oculomotor changes. We have previously framed oculomotor control as part of active vision, namely, a process of inference comprising two distinct but related challenges. The first is inferring where to look, and the second is inferring how to implement the selected action. In this paper, we draw from recent theoretical work on the neuromodulatory control of active inference. This allows us to simulate the sort of changes we would expect in oculomotor behaviour, following pharmacological enhancement or suppression of key neuromodulators—in terms of deciding where to look and the ensuing trajectory of the eye movement itself. We focus upon the influence of cholinergic and GABAergic agents on the speed of saccades, and consider dopaminergic and noradrenergic effects on more complex, memory-guided, behaviour. In principle, a computational approach to understanding the relationship between pharmacology and oculomotor behaviour affords the opportunity to estimate the influence of a given pharmaceutical upon neuronal function, and to use this to optimise therapeutic interventions on an individual basis.",

			"abstract": "For more than two decades, there has been converging evidence for an essential role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions. The cerebellum is not only important in learning and sensorimotor processes, some growing evidences show its implication in conditional learning and reward, which allows building our expectations about behavioral outcomes. More recent work has demonstrated that the cerebellum is also required for the sense of agency, a cognitive process that allows recognizing an action as our own, suggesting that the cerebellum might serve as an interface between sensorimotor function and cognition. A unifying model that would explain the role of the cerebellum across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, an important heritage was given by the field of motor control: the forward model theory. This theory stipulates that movements are controlled based on the constant interactions between our organism and its environment through feedforward and feedback loops. Feedforward loops predict what is going to happen, while feedback loops confront the prediction with what happened so that we can react accordingly. From an anatomical point of view, the cerebellum is at an ideal location at the interface between the motor and sensory systems, as it is connected to cerebral, striatal, and spinal entities via parallel loops, so that it can link sensory and motor systems with cognitive processes. Recent findings showing that the cerebellum participates in building the sense of agency as a predictive and comparator system will be reviewed together with past work on motor control within the context of the forward model theory.",

			"abstract": "The basal ganglia are thought to play a crucial role in reinforcement learning. Central to the learning mechanism are dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors located in the cortico-striatal synapses. However, it is still unclear how this DA-mediated synaptic plasticity is deployed and coordinated during reward-contingent behavioral changes. Here we propose a computational model of reinforcement learning that uses different thresholds of D1- and D2-mediated synaptic plasticity which are antagonized by DA-independent synaptic plasticity. A phasic increase in DA release caused by a larger-than-expected reward induces long-term potentiation (LTP) in the direct pathway, whereas a phasic decrease in DA release caused by a smaller-than-expected reward induces a cessation of long-term depression, leading to LTP in the indirect pathway. This learning mechanism can explain the robust behavioral adaptation observed in a location-reward-value-association task where the animal makes shorter latency saccades to reward locations. The changes in saccade latency become quicker as the monkey becomes more experienced. This behavior can be explained by a switching mechanism which activates the cortico-striatal circuit selectively. Our model also shows how D1- or D2-receptor blocking experiments affect selectively either reward or no-reward trials. The proposed mechanisms also explain the behavioral changes in Parkinson's disease.",

			"abstract": "Sense of agency refers to the feeling of controlling one's own actions and, through them, events in the external world.Sense of agency can be measured in experimental settings by asking participants to explicitly judge whether their action caused an outcome event or by using implicit measures, such as the compression of perceived time between action and outcome.Current models of motor control propose that the sense of agency is established retrospectively, by comparing delayed sensory feedback about actions and their consequences with the feedback predicted by an internal model. The connectivity between the frontal areas that develop motor plans for voluntary action and the parietal areas that monitor outcomes plays a key part in computing sense of agency.Processes in the frontal cortex occurring before the initiation of action also contribute to sense of agency. For example, selecting which of a number of alternative actions to make can increase the sense of agency over the subsequent outcome. These frontal contributions to agency operate prospectively and underlie the metacognitive experience of one's own voluntary action.Several neuropsychiatric disorders involve distorted or unreliable sense of agency. This suggests that successful computation of agency by the brain is a key element of normal consciousness and mental health.Many key features of modern human societies, such as social responsibility or use of advanced technologies, are based on the ability of the brain to compute agency correctly, even in complex interactions.",

			"abstract": "The ever increasingly stringent performance requirements of modern mechanical systems have forced control engineers to look beyond traditional linear control theory for more advanced nonlinear controllers. During the past decade, a mathematically rigorous nonlinear adaptive robust control (ARC) theory has been developed and has been experimentally demonstrated achieving significant performance improvement in a number of motion control applications. This plenary paper first uses a simple motion control problem as an example to bring out the conceptual connection and nonlinear extension of the widely used PID controller structure to the developed ARC approach. Through this example, some of the key underlying working mechanisms of the ARC theory can be grasped easily. The paper then highlights how major issues in the precision motion control can be handled systematically and effectively with the ARC framework. The issues considered include (i) large variations of physical parameters of a system; (ii) unknown nonlinearities such as cogging and ripple forces of linear motors; (iii) dynamic uncertain nonlinearities with non-uniformly detectable unmeasured internal states (e.g., friction described by dynamic models in high precision motion controls); and (iv) control input saturation due to limited capacity of physical actuators. The precision motion control of a linear motor driven high-speed/high-acceleration industrial gantry is used as a case study and comparative experimental results are presented to illustrate the achievable performance and limitations of various ARC controllers in implementation.",

			"abstract": "To behave adaptively in environments that are noisy and non-stationary, humans and other animals must monitor feedback from their environment and adjust their predictions and actions accordingly. An under-studied approach for modeling these adaptive processes comes from the engineering field of control theory, which provides general principles for regulating dynamical systems, often without requiring a generative model. The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is one of the most popular models of industrial process control. The proportional term is analogous to the “delta rule” in psychology, adjusting estimates in proportion to each successive error in prediction. The integral and derivative terms augment this update to simultaneously improve accuracy and stability. Here, we tested whether the PID algorithm can describe how people sequentially adjust their predictions in response to new information. Across three experiments, we found that the PID controller was an effective model of participants’ decisions in noisy, changing environments. In , we re-analyzed a change-point detection experiment, and showed that participants’ behavior incorporated elements of PID updating. In – we developed a task with gradual transitions that we optimized to detect PID-like adjustments. In both experiments, the PID model offered better descriptions of behavioral adjustments than both the classical delta-rule model and its more sophisticated variant, the Kalman filter. We further examined how participants weighted different PID terms in response to salient environmental events, finding that these control terms were modulated by reward, surprise, and outcome entropy. These experiments provide preliminary evidence that adaptive behavior in dynamic environments resembles PID control.",

			"abstract": "Introduction\nIn recent decades there has been a special interest in theories that could explain the regulation of motor control, and their applications. These theories are often based on models of brain function, philosophically reflecting different criteria on how movement is controlled by the brain, each being emphasised in different neural components of the movement. The concept of motor learning, regarded as the set of internal processes associated with practice and experience that produce relatively permanent changes in the ability to produce motor activities through a specific skill, is also relevant in the context of neuroscience. Thus, both motor control and learning are seen as key fields of study for health professionals in the field of neurorehabilitation.\nDevelopment\nThe major theories of motor control are described, which include, motor programming theory, systems theory, the theory of dynamic action, and the theory of parallel distributed processing, as well as the factors that influence motor learning and its applications in neurorehabilitation.\nConclusions\nAt present there is no consensus on which theory or model defines the regulations to explain motor control. Theories of motor learning should be the basis for motor rehabilitation. The new research should apply the knowledge generated in the fields of control and motor learning in neurorehabilitation.\nResumen\nIntroducción\nEn las últimas décadas ha existido un especial interés por las teorías que podrían explicar el gobierno del control motor y sus aplicaciones. Estas teorías suelen basarse en mode-los de función cerebral, reflejando criterios filosóficamente diferentes sobre la forma en la que el movimiento es controlado por el cerebro, enfatizando cada una de ellas en los distintos componentes neurales del movimiento. Asimismo, en el contexto de las neurociencias, toma relevancia el concepto de aprendizaje motor, considerado como el conjunto de procesos inter-nos asociados a la práctica, y la experiencia, que producen cambios relativamente permanentes en la capacidad de producir actividades motoras, a través de una habilidad específica. Por lo que ambos, control y aprendizaje motor, se posicionan como campos de estudio fundamentales para los profesionales sanitarios en el campo de la neurorrehabilitación.\nDesarrollo\nSe describen las principales teorías de control motor como la teoría de la programa-ción motora, la teoría de sistemas, la teoría de la acción dinámica o la teoría del procesamiento de distribución en paralelo, así como los factores que influyen en el aprendizaje motor y sus aplicaciones en neurorrehabilitación.\nConclusiones\nEn la actualidad no existe un consenso sobre qué teoría o modelo es definitorio en dar explicación al gobierno del control motor. Las teorías sobre el aprendizaje motor deben ser la base para la rehabilitación motora.

			"abstract": "Wilful movement requires neural control. Commonly, neural computations are thought to generate motor commands that bring the musculoskeletal system — that is, the plant — from its current physical state into a desired physical state. The current state can be estimated from past motor commands and from sensory information. Modelling movement on the basis of this concept of plant control strives to explain behaviour by identifying the computational principles for control signals that can reproduce the observed features of movements. From an alternative perspective, movements emerge in a dynamically coupled agent–environment system from the pursuit of subjective perceptual goals. Modelling movement on the basis of this concept of perceptual control aims to identify the controlled percepts and their coupling rules that can give rise to the observed characteristics of behaviour. In this Perspective, we discuss a broad spectrum of approaches to modelling human motor control and their notions of control signals, internal models, handling of sensory feedback delays and learning. We focus on the influence that the plant control and the perceptual control perspective may have on decisions when modelling empirical data, which may in turn shape our understanding of actions.",

			"abstract": "Sensorimotor control during overt movements is characterized in terms of three building blocks: a controller, a simulator and a state estimator. We asked whether the same framework could explain the control of internal states in the absence of movements. Recently, it was shown that the brain controls the timing of future movements by adjusting an internal speed command. We trained monkeys in a novel task in which the speed command had to be dynamically controlled based on the timing of a sequence of flashes. Recordings from the frontal cortex provided evidence that the brain updates the internal speed command after each flash based on the error between the timing of the flash and the anticipated timing of the flash derived from a simulated motor plan. These findings suggest that cognitive control of internal states may be understood in terms of the same computational principles as motor control.",

However, most attention is given to discrete tasks with simple action spaces, such as board games and classic video games. Less discussed in neuroscience are parallel advances in “synthetic motor control”. While motor neuroscience has recently focused on optimization of single, simple movements, AI has progressed to the generation of rich, diverse motor behaviors across multiple tasks, at humanoid scale. It is becoming clear that specific, well-motivated hierarchical design elements repeatedly arise when engineering these flexible control systems. We review these core principles of hierarchical control, relate them to hierarchy in the nervous system, and highlight research themes that we anticipate will be critical in solving challenges at this disciplinary intersection.",

			"abstract": "Skilled sensorimotor interactions with the world result from a series of decision-making processes that determine, on the basis of information extracted during the unfolding sequence of events, which movements to make and when and how to make them. Despite this inherent link between decision-making and sensorimotor control, research into each of these two areas has largely evolved in isolation, and it is only fairly recently that researchers have begun investigating how they interact and, together, influence behaviour. Here, we review recent behavioural, neurophysiological and computational research that highlights the role of decision-making processes in the selection, planning and control of goal-directed movements in humans and nonhuman primates.",

			"abstract": "The basal ganglia are more highly interconnected with the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) than with any other brain region. Regulation and relay of basal ganglia activity are two key functions of the PPN. The PPN provides an interface for the basal ganglia to influence sleep and waking, and the two structures are similarly implicated in learning, reward and other cognitive functions. Perturbations of basal ganglia activity have consequences for the PPN and vice versa, exemplified by their interdependencies in motor function and Parkinson's disease. Thus, close anatomical and physiological links between the PPN and basal ganglia make it increasingly difficult to consider the two as separate functional entities.",

			"abstract": "Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons play a central role in a wide range of behaviors, from attention and motivation to motor control and reinforcement. The release of DA is modulated by a number of factors, and its deregulation has been implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders, such as addiction. In particular, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are key modulators of DA cells. Nicotine, the main addictive component in tobacco, strongly interacts with these receptors in the midbrain DA systems, resulting in reinforcing effects that are at the core of tobacco addiction. nAChRs are virtually expressed on every cell of the DA system, both at pre-, post- and extra-synaptic locations. The complex issue of interpreting the role of the large portfolio of different nAChR subtypes expressed on ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons, and especially their role in defining functional DAergic subpopulations, is far from being solved. In this review we will try to provide the reader with an integrative view of the nicotinic modulation of DA neurons and its influence at the cellular, systemic and behavioral levels (exploratory behavior), as well as its implication in the reinforcing effects of nicotine.",

			"abstract": "The ability to make adaptive decisions during goal-directed navigation is a fundamental and highly evolved behavior that requires continual coordination of perceptions, learning and memory processes, and the planning of behaviors. Here, a neurobiological account for such coordination is provided by integrating current literatures on spatial context analysis and decision-making. This integration includes discussions of our current understanding of the role of the hippocampal system in experience-dependent navigation, how hippocampal information comes to impact midbrain and striatal decision making systems, and finally the role of the striatum in the implementation of behaviors based on recent decisions. These discussions extend across cellular to neural systems levels of analysis. Not only are key findings described, but also fundamental organizing principles within and across neural systems, as well as between neural systems functions and behavior, are emphasized. It is suggested that studying decision making during goal-directed navigation is a powerful model for studying interactive brain systems and their mediation of complex behaviors.",

			"abstract": "In this article, we challenge the usefulness of “attention” as a unitary construct and/or neural system. We point out that the concept has too many meanings to justify a single term, and that “attention” is used to refer to both the explanandum (the set of phenomena in need of explanation) and the explanans (the set of processes doing the explaining). To illustrate these points, we focus our discussion on visual selective attention. It is argued that selectivity in processing has emerged through evolution as a design feature of a complex multi-channel sensorimotor system, which generates selective phenomena of “attention” as one of many by-products. Instead of the traditional analytic approach to attention, we suggest a synthetic approach that starts with well-understood mechanisms that do not need to be dedicated to attention, and yet account for the selectivity phenomena under investigation. We conclude that what would serve scientific progress best would be to drop the term “attention” as a label for a specific functional or neural system and instead focus on behaviorally relevant selection processes and the many systems that implement them.",

			"abstract": "Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have shown that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) distinguishes between the planning of eye and hand movements. This distinction has usually been interpreted as evidence for a modular, effector-specific organization of this cerebral region. However, the eyes differ markedly from other body parts both in terms of their functional purpose and with regard to the spatial transformations required to plan goal-directed movements. PPC may therefore provide specialized subregions for eye movements, but distinguish less for other effectors. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared activity during memory-guided eye, hand, and foot movements in human participants. The results did not reveal any significant activation differences during the planning of hand and foot movements, except in the most anterior part of PPC [Brodmann's area (BA) 5], marginally extending into anterior BA 7/40. This region showed a lateral-to-medial gradient for hand versus foot movement planning. The limb-unspecific PPC regions were functionally connected with hand and foot motor regions. In contrast, a gradient-like organization was found for all of PPC for the planning of eye versus hand and foot movements. Although planning-related activity across the three effectors considerably overlapped, saccade planning activated occipitoparietal regions more than limb movements, whereas limb movements activated anterior regions of the superior parietal lobule more than saccades. We infer that PPC does not follow a strict effector-specific organization. Rather, the large-scale organization of this region might reflect the different computational constraints that need to be satisfied when planning eye and limb movements.",

			"abstract": "Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare activity in the human parietal cortex in two attention-switching paradigms. On each trial of the visual switching (VS) paradigm, subjects attended to one of two visual stimuli on the basis of either their color or shape. Trials were presented in blocks interleaved with cues instructing subjects to either continue attending to the currently relevant dimension or to switch to the other stimulus dimension. In the response switching (RS) paradigm, subjects made one of two manual responses to the single stimulus presented on each trial. The rules for stimulus–response mapping were reversed on different trials. Trials were presented in blocks interleaved with cues that instructed subjects to either switch stimulus–response mapping rules or to continue with the current rule. Brain activity at “switch” and “stay” events was compared. The results revealed distinct parietal areas concerned with visual attentional set shifts (VS) and visuomotor intentional set shifts (RS). In VS, activity was recorded in the lateral part of the intraparietal region. In RS, activity was recorded in the posterior medial intraparietal region and adjacent posterior superior and dorsomedial parietal cortex. The results also suggest that the basic functional organization of the intraparietal sulcus and surrounding regions is similar in both macaque and human species.",

			"abstract": "Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in sensory and motor processing, but its underlying organization is still debated. Sensory-based accounts suggest that PPC is mainly involved in attentional selection and multisensory integration, serving novelty detection and information seeking. Motor-specific accounts suggest a parietal subdivision into lower-dimensional, effector-specific subspaces for planning motor action. More recently, function-based interpretations have been put forward based on coordinated responses across multiple effectors evoked by circumscribed PPC regions. In this review, we posit that an overarching interpretation of PPC’s functional organization must integrate, rather than contrast, these various accounts of PPC. We propose that PPC’s main role is that of a state estimator that extends into two poles: a rostral, body-related pole that projects the environment onto the body and a caudal, environment-related pole that projects the body into an environment landscape. The combined topology interweaves perceptual, motor, and function-specific principles, and suggests that actions are specified by top-down guided optimization of body-environment interactions.",

			"abstract": "Egocentric neural coding has been observed in parietal cortex (PC), but its topographical and laminar organization is not well characterized. We used multi-site recording to look for evidence of local clustering and laminar consistency of linear and angular velocity encoding in multi-neuronal spiking activity (MUA) and in the high-frequency (300–900 Hz) component of the local field potential (HF-LFP), believed to reflect local spiking activity. Rats were trained to run many trials on a large circular platform, either to LED-cued goal locations or as a spatial sequence from memory. Tuning to specific self-motion states was observed and exhibited distinct cortical depth-invariant coding properties. These patterns of collective local and laminar activation during behavior were reactivated in compressed form during post-experience sleep and temporally coupled to cortical delta waves and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. Thus, PC neuron motion encoding is consistent across cortical laminae, and this consistency is maintained during memory reactivation.",

Neurons in the motor cortex command the changes in muscle activity required to modify limb trajectory when stepping over obstacles. Simultaneously, neurons in the brainstem reticular formation ensure that these modifications are superimposed on an appropriate base of postural support. Recent experiments suggest that the same neurons in the same structures also provide similar information during reaching movements. It is suggested that, during both locomotion and reaching movements, the final expression of descending signals is influenced by the state and excitability of the spinal circuits upon which they impinge.",

			"abstract": "Locomotion is a complex motor act that, to a large degree, is controlled by neuronal circuits in the spinal cord. Using a systems neuroscience approach in several model systems of non-limbed and limbed animals, important advances have been made in revealing the functional organization of the spinal locomotor networks.The key circuit elements in the spinal locomotor networks are the rhythm-generating circuits and the pattern-generating circuits, which include circuits that control bilateral muscle activity, and circuits that control flexor–extensor muscles in limbed animals.Comparison of the network organization of the key circuit elements in limbed and non-limbed animals reveals both commonalities and differences in organization.The commonalities extend to the basic components of inhibitory left–right alternating circuits and excitatory neurons involved in rhythm generation.The differences include left–right alternating circuitries that have multiple components in legged animals compared with the control of axial muscles in fish where one component dominates, rhythm-generating neurons that originate from developmentally diverse progenitors in fish and mice, and elaborated reciprocal network circuits involved in the flexor–extensor coordination that is found in legged animals, which do not have direct counterparts in non-legged animals.Locomotor networks, whether they control swimming or over-ground locomotion, are built around modules of rhythm- and pattern-generating modules.Functional network reorganization occurs with changes in the speed of locomotion or changes in gait. This reconfiguration takes places both at the level of rhythm generation and at the level of pattern generation.The exact mechanisms of rhythm generation are not generally understood across phyla but seem to depend on an interplay between active membrane properties and network properties.Proprioception suggests an important role for phase switching during locomotion.The combination of electrophysiological and molecular genetic approaches has revealed details of the organization of large-scale spinal networks in limbed animals in considerably different ways than previous research has suggested and has allowed for comparison with network organization in leg-less animals with more limited numbers of cells in the spinal cord. Although these fundamental motor networks have begun to be decoded, there are still unresolved issues regarding their functional organization.",

			"abstract": "Throughout the course of evolution there has been a parallel development of the complexity and flexibility of the nervous system and the skeletomuscular system that it controls. This development is particularly evident for the cerebral cortical areas and the transformation of the use of the upper limbs from a purely locomotor function to one including, or restricted to, reaching and grasping. This study addresses the issue of whether the control of reaching has involved the development of new cortical circuits or whether the same neurons are used to control both locomotion and reaching. We recorded the activity of pyramidal tract neurons in the motor cortex of the cat both during voluntary gait modifications and during reaching. All cells showed generally similar patterns of activity in both tasks. More specifically, we showed that, in many cases, cells maintained a constant temporal relationship to the activity of synergistic muscle groups in each task. In addition, in some cells the relationship between the intensity of the cell discharge activity and the magnitude of the EMG activity was equally constant during gait modifications and reaching. As such, the results are compatible with the hypothesis that the corticospinal circuits used to control reaching evolved from those used to precisely modify gait.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In an article in 1989, Georgopoulos and Grillner (1989) proposed that the corticospinal control mechanisms used for reaching movements in primates may have evolved from those used to control precise modifications of gait during quadrupedal locomotion. In this article, we provide a test of this hypothesis by recording the activity of individual motor cortical cells during both behaviors. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis in that they demonstrate that individual cortical neurons exhibit similar qualitative and quantitative patterns during each behavior. Beyond a general similarity of activity patterns, we show that some cortical cells have the same relative relationship, in both phase and magnitude, to the muscle activity observed in both reach and locomotor tasks.",

			"abstract": "The concept of affordances appeared in psychology during the late 60s as an alternative perspective on the visual perception of the environment. It was revolutionary in the intuition that the way living beings perceive the world is deeply influenced by the actions they are able to perform. Then, across the last 40 years, it has influenced many applied fields, e.g., design, human-computer interaction, computer vision, and robotics. In this paper, we offer a multidisciplinary perspective on the notion of affordances. We first discuss the main definitions and formalizations of the affordance theory, then we report the most significant evidence in psychology and neuroscience that support it, and finally we review the most relevant applications of this concept in robotics.",

			"abstract": "Although there are well-known limitations of the human cognitive system in performing two tasks simultaneously (dual-tasking) or alternatingly (task-switching), the question for a common vs. distinct neural basis of these multitasking limitations is still open. We performed two Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies on dual-tasking or task-switching and tested for commonalities and differences in the brain regions associated with either domain. We found a common core network related to multitasking comprising bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), left dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), and right anterior insula. Meta-analytic contrasts revealed eight fronto-parietal clusters more consistently activated in dual-tasking (bilateral frontal operculum, dPMC, and anterior IPS, left inferior frontal sulcus and left inferior frontal gyrus) and, conversely, four clusters (left inferior frontal junction, posterior IPS, and precuneus as well as frontomedial cortex) more consistently activated in task-switching. Together with sub-analyses of preparation effects in task-switching, our results argue against purely passive structural processing limitations in multitasking. Based on these findings and drawing on current theorizing, we present a neuro-cognitive processing model of multitasking.",

Historically viewed as a simple sensorimotor controller with homogeneous architecture, the cerebellum is increasingly implicated in cognitive functions. It possesses an impressive diversity of molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms, embedded in a dynamic, recurrent circuit architecture. Recent insights about the diversity and dynamism of the cerebellum provide a roadmap for the next decade of cerebellar research, challenging some old concepts, reinvigorating others and defining major new research directions.",

			"abstract": "Over the past several decades, theories about cerebellar learning have evolved. A relatively simple view that highlighted the contribution of one major form of heterosynaptic plasticity to cerebellar motor learning has given way to a plethora of perspectives that suggest that many different forms of synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity, acting at various sites, can control multiple types of learning behaviour. However, there still seem to be contradictions between the various hypotheses with regard to the mechanisms underlying cerebellar learning. The challenge is therefore to reconcile these different views and unite them into a single overall concept. Here I review our current understanding of the changes in the activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells in different ‘microzones’ during various forms of learning. I describe an emerging model that indicates that the activity of each microzone is bound to either increase or decrease during the initial stages of learning, depending on the directional and temporal demands of its downstream circuitry and the behaviour involved.",

			"abstract": "The striatum is a heterogeneous structure with a diverse range of neuron types and neuromodulators. Three decades of anatomical and biochemical studies have established that the neurochemical organization of striatum is not uniformly heterogeneous, but rather, can be differentiated into neurochemically discrete compartments known as striosomes (also known as patches) and matrix. These compartments are well understood to differ in their expression of neurochemical markers, with some differences in afferent and efferent connectivity and have also been suggested to have different involvement in a range of neurological diseases. However, the functional outcomes of striosome–matrix organization are poorly understood. Now, recent findings and new experimental tools are beginning to reveal that the distinctions between striosomes and matrix have distinct consequences for striatal synapse function. Here, we review recent findings that suggest there can be distinct regulation of neural function in striosome versus matrix compartments, particularly compartment-specific neurochemical interactions. We highlight that new transgenic and viral tools are becoming available that should now accelerate the pace of advances in understanding of these long-mysterious striatal compartments.",

			"abstract": "The neural circuits that control eye movements are complex and distributed in brainstem, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and multiple areas of cortex. The anatomical function of the substrates implicated in eye movements has been studied for decades in numerous countries, laboratories, and clinics. The modest goal of this brief review is twofold. (1) To present a focused overview of the knowledge about the role of the cerebral cortex in voluntary control of eye movements. (2) To very briefly mention two findings showing that the accepted hierarchy between the frontal and the occipital sensory areas involved in sensory–motor transformation might not be so trivial to reconcile, and to interpret in the context of eye movement command. This presentation has been part of the 44th Cambridge Ophthalmological Symposium, on ocular motility, 3 September 2014 to 5 November 2014.",

			"abstract": "Integration of sensory and motor information is one-step, among others, that underlies the successful production of goal-directed hand movements necessary for interacting with our environment. Disruption of sensorimotor integration is prevalent in many neurologic disorders, including stroke. In most stroke survivors, persistent paresis of the hand reduces function and overall quality of life. Current rehabilitative methods are based on neuroplastic principles to promote motor learning that focuses on regaining motor function lost due to paresis, but the sensory contributions to motor control and learning are often overlooked and currently understudied. There is a need to evaluate and understand the contribution of both sensory and motor function in the rehabilitation of skilled hand movements after stroke. Here, we will highlight the importance of integration of sensory and motor information to produce skilled hand movements in healthy individuals and individuals after stroke. We will then discuss how compromised sensorimotor integration influences relearning of skilled hand movements after stroke. Finally, we will propose an approach to target sensorimotor integration through manipulation of sensory input and motor output that may have therapeutic implications.",

The cerebellum fine-tunes each of the subtypes of eye movements so they work together to bring and maintain images of objects of interest on the fovea.

The approach will be based on structural–functional correlation, combining the effects of lesions and the results from physiologic studies, with the emphasis on the cerebellar regions known to be most closely related to ocular motor function: (1) the flocculus/paraflocculus for high-frequency (brief) vestibular responses, sustained pursuit eye movements, and gaze holding, (2) the nodulus/ventral uvula for low-frequency (sustained) vestibular responses, and (3) the dorsal oculomotor vermis and its target in the posterior portion of the fastigial nucleus (the fastigial oculomotor region) for saccades and pursuit initiation.",

			"abstract": "The physiology of climbing fiber signals in cerebellar Purkinje cells has been studied since the early days of electrophysiology. Both the climbing fiber-evoked complex spike and the role of climbing fiber activity in the induction of long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses have become hallmark features of cerebellar physiology. However, the key role of climbing fiber signaling in cerebellar motor learning has been challenged by recent reports of forms of synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex that do not involve climbing fiber activity, but might well play a role in cerebellar learning. Moreover, cerebellar LTD does not seem to strictly require climbing fiber activity. These observations make it necessary to re-evaluate the role of climbing fiber signaling in cerebellar function. Here, we argue that climbing fiber signaling is about adjusting relative probabilities for the induction of LTD and long-term potentiation (LTP) at parallel fiber synapses. Complex spike-associated, dendritic calcium transients control postsynaptic LTD and LTP induction. High calcium transients, provided by complex spike activity, do not only favor postsynaptic LTD induction, but simultaneously trigger retrograde cannabinoid signaling, which blocks the induction of presynaptic LTP. Plasticity of the climbing fiber input itself provides additional means to fine-tune complex spike associated calcium signaling and thus to adjust the gain of heterosynaptic climbing fiber control. In addition to dendritic calcium transients, climbing fiber activity leads to the release of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which facilitates LTD induction at both parallel fiber and climbing fiber synapses.",

Although behavioral studies have demonstrated that these internal models are optimally adapted to the statistics of the environment, the neural underpinning of this adaptation is unknown. Using a Bayesian model of sensory cortical processing, we related stimulus-evoked and spontaneous neural activities to inferences and prior expectations in an internal model and predicted that they should match if the model is statistically optimal. To test this prediction, we analyzed visual cortical activity of awake ferrets during development. Similarity between spontaneous and evoked activities increased with age and was specific to responses evoked by natural scenes. This demonstrates the progressive adaptation of internal models to the statistics of natural stimuli at the neural level.",

			"abstract": "Each of the descending pathways involved in motor control has a number of anatomical, molecular, pharmacological, and neuroinformatic characteristics. They are differentially involved in motor control, a process that results from operations involving the entire motor network rather than from the brain commanding the spinal cord. A given pathway can have many functional roles. This review explores to what extent descending pathways are highly conserved across species and concludes that there are actually rather widespread species differences, for example, in the transmission of information from the corticospinal tract to upper limb motoneurons. The significance of direct, cortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections, which were discovered a little more than 50 years ago, is reassessed. I conclude that although these connections operate in parallel with other less direct linkages to motoneurons, CM influence is significant and may subserve some special functions including adaptive motor behaviors involving the distal extremities.",

			"abstract": "The present study identifies the mechanics of planar reaching movements performed by monkeys (Macaca mulatta) wearing a robotic exoskeleton. This device maintained the limb in the horizontal plane such that hand motion was generated only by flexor and extensor motions at the shoulder and elbow. The study describes the kinematic and kinetic features of the shoulder, elbow, and hand during reaching movements from a central target to peripheral targets located on the circumference of a circle: the center-out task. While subjects made reaching movements with relatively straight smooth hand paths and little variation in peak hand velocity, there were large variations in joint motion, torque, and power for movements in different spatial directions. Unlike single-joint movements, joint kinematics and kinetics were not tightly coupled for these multijoint movements. For most movements, power generation was predominantly generated at only one of the two joints. The present analysis illustrates the complexities inherent in multijoint movements and forms the basis for understanding strategies used by the motor system to control reaching movements and for interpreting the response of neurons in different brain regions during this task.",

			"abstract": "The precision of skilled movement depends on sensory feedback and its refinement by local inhibitory microcircuits. One specialized set of spinal GABAergic interneurons forms axo–axonic contacts with the central terminals of sensory afferents, exerting presynaptic inhibitory control over sensory–motor transmission. The inability to achieve selective access to the GABAergic neurons responsible for this unorthodox inhibitory mechanism has left unresolved the contribution of presynaptic inhibition to motor behaviour. We used Gad2 as a genetic entry point to manipulate the interneurons that contact sensory terminals, and show that activation of these interneurons in mice elicits the defining physiological characteristics of presynaptic inhibition. Selective genetic ablation of Gad2-expressing interneurons severely perturbs goal-directed reaching movements, uncovering a pronounced and stereotypic forelimb motor oscillation, the core features of which are captured by modelling the consequences of sensory feedback at high gain. Our findings define the neural substrate of a genetically hardwired gain control system crucial for the smooth execution of movement.",

			"abstract": "Human studies in the past three decades have provided us with an emerging understanding of how cortical and spinal networks collaborate to ensure the vast repertoire of human behaviors. Humans have direct cortical connections to spinal motoneurons, which bypass spinal interneurons and exert a direct (willful) muscle control with the aid of a context-dependent integration of somatosensory and visual information at cortical level. However, spinal networks also play an important role. Sensory feedback through spinal circuitries is integrated with central motor commands and contributes importantly to the muscle activity underlying voluntary movements. Regulation of spinal interneurons is used to switch between motor states such as locomotion (reciprocal innervation) and stance (coactivation pattern). Cortical regulation of presynaptic inhibition of sensory afferents may focus the central motor command by opening or closing sensory feedback pathways. In the future, human studies of spinal motor control, in close collaboration with animal studies on the molecular biology of the spinal cord, will continue to document the neural basis for human behavior.",

			"abstract": "The performance of motor tasks requires the coordinated control and continuous adjustment of myriad individual muscles. The basic commands for the successful performance of a sensorimotor task originate in “higher” centers such as the motor cortex, but the actual muscle activation and resulting torques and motion are considerably shaped by the integrative function of the spinal interneurons. The relative contributions of brain and spinal cord are less clear for reaching movements than for automatic tasks such as locomotion. We have modeled a two-axis, four-muscle wrist joint with realistic musculoskeletal mechanics and proprioceptors and a network of regulatory circuitry based on the classical types of spinal interneurons (propriospinal, monosynaptic Ia-excitatory, reciprocal Ia-inhibitory, Renshaw inhibitory, and Ib-inhibitory pathways) and their supraspinal control (via biasing activity, presynaptic inhibition, and fusimotor gain). The modeled system has a very large number of control inputs, not unlike the real spinal cord that the brain must learn to control to produce desired behaviors. It was surprisingly easy to program this model to emulate actual performance in four very different but well described behaviors: (1) stabilizing responses to force perturbations; (2) rapid movement to position target; (3) isometric force to a target level; and (4) adaptation to viscous curl force fields.

			"abstract": "This paper surveys the developments of the last 20 years in the field of central pattern generator (CPG) inspired locomotion control, with particular emphasis on the fast emerging robotics-related applications. Functioning as a biological neural network, CPGs can be considered as a group of coupled neurons that generate rhythmic signals without sensory feedback; however, sensory feedback is needed to shape the CPG signals. The basic idea in engineering endeavors is to replicate this intrinsic, computationally efficient, distributed control mechanism for multiple articulated joints, or multi-DOF control cases. In terms of various abstraction levels, existing CPG control models and their extensions are reviewed with a focus on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the models, including ease of design and implementation. The main issues arising from design, optimization, and implementation of the CPG-based control as well as possible alternatives are further discussed, with an attempt to shed more light on locomotion control-oriented theories and applications. The design challenges and trends associated with the further advancement of this area are also summarized.",

			"abstract": "This paper reports about our investigation on action understanding in the brain. We review recent results of the neurophysiology of the mirror system in the monkey. Based on these observations we propose a model of this brain system which is responsible for action recognition. The link between object affordances and action understanding is considered. To support our hypothesis we describe two experiments where some aspects of the model have been implemented. In the first experiment an action recognition system is trained by using data recorded from human movements. In the second experiment, the model is partially implemented on a humanoid robot which learns to mimic simple actions performed by a human subject on different objects. These experiments show that motor information can have a significant role in action interpretation and that a mirror-like representation can be developed autonomously as a result of the interaction between an individual and the environment.",

			"abstract": "The process of moving the hand to a target in space involves a series of sensorimotor transformations that translate visual and other sensory information about the location of the target object and the limbs into a set of motor commands that will bring the hand to the desired position. Recent work at various laboratories has provided strong support for the hypothesis that the CNS learns and maintains internal models of sensorimotor transformations. An internal model is a neural system that mimics the behaviour of the sensorimotor system and objects in the external environment. Internal models enable the CNS to predict the consequences of motor commands and to determine the motor commands required to perform specific tasks. In this chapter, we first summarize recent computational, behavioural and neurophysiological studies that address the theoretical necessity of internal models, the locations of internal models, and the neural mechanism for acquiring internal models through learning. Then, we propose a new computational model of multiple internal models.",

			"abstract": "Mirror neurons are neurons whose responses to the observation of a motor act resemble responses measured during production of that act. Computationally, mirror neurons have been viewed as evidence for the existence of internal inverse models. Such models, rooted within control theory, map-desired sensory targets onto the motor commands required to generate those targets. To jointly explore both the formation of mirrored responses and their functional contribution to inverse models, we develop a correlation-based theory of interactions between a sensory and a motor area. We show that a simple eligibility-weighted Hebbian learning rule, operating within a sensorimotor loop during motor explorations and stabilized by heterosynaptic competition, naturally gives rise to mirror neurons as well as control theoretic inverse models encoded in the synaptic weights from sensory to motor neurons. Crucially, we find that the correlational structure or stereotypy of the neural code underlying motor explorations determines the nature of the learned inverse model: random motor codes lead to causal inverses that map sensory activity patterns to their motor causes; such inverses are maximally useful, by allowing the imitation of arbitrary sensory target sequences. By contrast, stereotyped motor codes lead to less useful predictive inverses that map sensory activity to future motor actions. Our theory generalizes previous work on inverse models by showing that such models can be learned in a simple Hebbian framework without the need for error signals or backpropagation, and it makes new conceptual connections between the causal nature of inverse models, the statistical structure of motor variability, and the time-lag between sensory and motor responses of mirror neurons. Applied to bird song learning, our theory can account for puzzling aspects of the song system, including necessity of sensorimotor gating and selectivity of auditory responses to bird's own song (BOS) stimuli.",

			"abstract": "Although our ability to store semantic declarative information can nowadays be readily surpassed by that of simple personal computers, our ability to learn and express procedural memories still outperforms that of supercomputers controlling the most advanced robots. To a large extent, our procedural memories are formed in the cerebellum, which embodies more than two-thirds of all neurons in our brain. In this review, we will focus on the emerging view that different modules of the cerebellum use different encoding schemes to form and express their respective memories. More specifically, zebrin-positive zones in the cerebellum, such as those controlling adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, appear to predominantly form their memories by potentiation mechanisms and express their memories via rate coding, whereas zebrin-negative zones, such as those controlling eyeblink conditioning, appear to predominantly form their memories by suppression mechanisms and express their memories in part by temporal coding using rebound bursting. Together, the different types of modules offer a rich repertoire to acquire and control sensorimotor processes with specific challenges in the spatiotemporal domain.",

			"abstract": "BackgroundRecently, muscle synergy analysis has become a standard methodology for extracting coordination patterns from electromyographic (EMG) signals, and for the evaluation of motor control strategies in many contexts. Most previous studies have characterized upper-limb muscle synergies across a limited set of reaching movements. With the aim of future uses in motor control, rehabilitation and other fields, this study provides a comprehensive characterization of muscle synergies in a large set of upper-limb tasks and also considers inter-individual and environmental variability.MethodsSixteen healthy subjects performed upper-limb hand exploration movements for a comprehensive mapping of the upper-limb workspace, which was divided into several sectors (Frontal, Right, Left, Horizontal, and Up). EMGs from representative upper-limb muscles and kinematics were recorded to extract muscle synergies and explore the composition, repeatability and similarity of spatial synergies across subjects and movement directions, in a context of high variability of motion.ResultsEven in a context of high variability, a reduced set of muscle synergies may reconstruct the original EMG envelopes. Composition, repeatability and similarity of synergies were found to be shared across subjects and sectors, even if at a lower extent than previously reported.ConclusionExtending the results of previous studies, which were performed on a smaller set of conditions, a limited number of muscle synergies underlie the execution of a large variety of upper-limb tasks. However, the considered spatial domain and the variability seem to influence the number and composition of muscle synergies. Such detailed characterization of the modular organization of the muscle patterns for upper-limb control in a large variety of tasks may provide a useful reference for studies on motor control, rehabilitation, industrial applications, and sports.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum is an important contributor to feedforward control mechanisms of the central nervous system, and sequencing—the process that allows spatial and temporal relationships between events to be recognized—has been implicated as the fundamental cerebellar mode of operation. By adopting such a mode and because cerebellar activity patterns are sensitive to a variety of sensorimotor-related tasks, the cerebellum is believed to support motor and cognitive functions that are encoded in the frontal and parietal lobes of the cerebral cortex. In this model, the cerebellum is hypothesized to make predictions about the consequences of a motor or cognitive command that originates from the cortex to prepare the entire system to cope with ongoing changes. In this framework, cerebellar predictive mechanisms for locomotion are addressed, focusing on sensorial and motoric sequencing. The hypothesis that sequence recognition is the mechanism by which the cerebellum functions in gait control is presented and discussed.",

			"abstract": "Complex spikes generated in a cerebellar Purkinje cell via a climbing fiber have been assumed to encode errors in the performance of neuronal circuits involving Purkinje cells. To reexamine this notion in this review, I analyzed structures of motor control systems involving the cerebellum. A dichotomy was found between the two types of error: sensory and motor errors play roles in the feedforward and feedback control conditions, respectively. To substantiate this dichotomy, here in this article I reviewed recent data on neuronal connections and signal contents of climbing fibers in the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), optokinetic eye movement response, saccade, hand reaching, cursor tracking, as well as some other cases of motor control. In our studies, various sources of sensory and motor errors were located in the neuronal pathways leading to the inferior olive. We noted that during the course of evolution, control system structures involving the cerebellum changed rather radically from the prototype seen in the flocculonodular lobe and vermis to that applicable to the cerebellar hemisphere. Nevertheless, the dichotomy between sensory and motor errors is maintained.",

Patients with cerebellar lesions are reported to have deficits in performing one or another cognitive task. The cerebellum is often seen to be activated when normal subjects perform such tasks. There are connections to and from areas of the prefrontal cortex that may be involved in cognition. In this paper, we review the anatomical evidence to support the claim. We suggest that there are only minor connections with cognitive areas of the cerebral cortex and that some of the imaging evidence may reflect the cerebellum’s role in the control of eye movements rather than cognition.",

Although the cerebellum is not been considered an elective dopaminergic region, studies attributed to it a critical role in dopamine deficit-related neurological and psychiatric disorders [e.g., Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia (SCZ)]. Data on the cerebellar dopaminergic neuronal system are still lacking. Nevertheless, biochemical studies detected in the mammalians cerebellum high dopamine levels, while chemical neuroanatomy studies revealed the presence of midbrain dopaminergic afferents to the cerebellum as well as wide distribution of the dopaminergic receptor subtypes (DRD1-DRD5). The present review summarizes the data on the cerebellar dopaminergic system including its involvement in associative and projective circuits. Furthermore, this study also briefly discusses the role of the cerebellar dopaminergic system in some neurologic and psychiatric disorders and suggests its potential involvement as a target in pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments.",

			"abstract": "Both the environment and our body keep changing dynamically. Hence, ensuring movement precision requires adaptation to multiple demands occurring simultaneously. Here we show that the cerebellum performs the necessary multi-dimensional computations for the flexible control of different movement parameters depending on the prevailing context. This conclusion is based on the identification of a manifold-like activity in both mossy fibers (MFs, network input) and Purkinje cells (PCs, output), recorded from monkeys performing a saccade task. Unlike MFs, the PC manifolds developed selective representations of individual movement parameters. Error feedback-driven climbing fiber input modulated the PC manifolds to predict specific, error type-dependent changes in subsequent actions. Furthermore, a feed-forward network model that simulated MF-to-PC transformations revealed that amplification and restructuring of the lesser variability in the MF activity is a pivotal circuit mechanism. Therefore, the flexible control of movements by the cerebellum crucially depends on its capacity for multi-dimensional computations.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum generates its vast amount of output to the cerebral cortex through the dentate nucleus (DN) that is essential for precise limb movements in primates. Nuclear cells in DN generate burst activity prior to limb movement, and inactivation of DN results in cerebellar ataxia. The question is how DN cells become active under intensive inhibitory drive from Purkinje cells (PCs). There are two excitatory inputs to DN, mossy fiber and climbing fiber collaterals, but neither of them appears to have sufficient strength for generation of burst activity in DN. Therefore, we can assume two possible mechanisms: post-inhibitory rebound excitation and disinhibition. If rebound excitation works, phasic excitation of PCs and a concomitant inhibition of DN cells should precede the excitation of DN cells. On the other hand, if disinhibition plays a primary role, phasic suppression of PCs and activation of DN cells should be observed at the same timing. To examine these two hypotheses, we compared the activity patterns of PCs in the cerebrocerebellum and DN cells during step-tracking wrist movements in three Japanese monkeys. As a result, we found that the majority of wrist-movement-related PCs were suppressed prior to movement onset and the majority of wrist-movement-related DN cells showed concurrent burst activity without prior suppression. In a minority of PCs and DN cells, movement-related increases and decreases in activity, respectively, developed later. These activity patterns suggest that the initial burst activity in DN cells is generated by reduced inhibition from PCs, i.e., by disinhibition. Our results indicate that suppression of PCs, which has been considered secondary to facilitation, plays the primary role in generating outputs from DN. Our findings provide a new perspective on the mechanisms used by PCs to influence limb motor control and on the plastic changes that underlie motor learning in the cerebrocerebellum.",

			"abstract": "Encoding of movement kinematics in Purkinje cell simple spike discharge has important implications for hypotheses of cerebellar cortical function. Several outstanding questions remain regarding representation of these kinematic signals. It is uncertain whether kinematic encoding occurs in unpredictable, feedback-dependent tasks or kinematic signals are conserved across tasks. Additionally, there is a need to understand the signals encoded in the instantaneous discharge of single cells without averaging across trials or time. To address these questions, this study recorded Purkinje cell firing in monkeys trained to perform a manual random tracking task in addition to circular tracking and center-out reach. Random tracking provides for extensive coverage of kinematic workspaces. Direction and speed errors are significantly greater during random than circular tracking. Cross-correlation analyses comparing hand and target velocity profiles show that hand velocity lags target velocity during random tracking. Correlations between simple spike firing from 120 Purkinje cells and hand position, velocity, and speed were evaluated with linear regression models including a time constant, τ, as a measure of the firing lead/lag relative to the kinematic parameters. Across the population, velocity accounts for the majority of simple spike firing variability (63 ± 30% of Radj2), followed by position (28 ± 24% of Radj2) and speed (11 ± 19% of Radj2). Simple spike firing often leads hand kinematics. Comparison of regression models based on averaged vs. nonaveraged firing and kinematics reveals lower Radj2 values for nonaveraged data; however, regression coefficients and τ values are highly similar. Finally, for most cells, model coefficients generated from random tracking accurately estimate simple spike firing in either circular tracking or center-out reach. These findings imply that the cerebellum controls movement kinematics, consistent with a forward internal model that predicts upcoming limb kinematics.",

			"abstract": "To understand how the cerebellar cortex transforms mossy fiber (MF) inputs into Purkinje cell (PC) outputs, it is vital to delineate the elements of this circuit. Candelabrum cells (CCs) are enigmatic interneurons of the cerebellar cortex that have been identified based on their morphology, but their electrophysiological properties, synaptic connections and function remain unknown. Here, we clarify these properties using electrophysiology, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization and serial electron microscopy in mice. We find that CCs are the most abundant PC layer interneuron. They are GABAergic, molecularly distinct and present in all cerebellar lobules. Their high resistance renders CC firing highly sensitive to synaptic inputs. CCs are excited by MFs and granule cells and are strongly inhibited by PCs. CCs in turn primarily inhibit molecular layer interneurons, which leads to PC disinhibition. Thus, inputs, outputs and local signals converge onto CCs to allow them to assume a unique role in controlling cerebellar output.",

Yet, now that many other brain regions have been explored and neurophysiologists are turning to questions of how larger circuits operate, these two characteristics are starting to seem more attractive. First, the relay nature of thalamic neurons means that recording from them, like tapping into a wire, can reveal the signals carried by specific circuits. Second, the concentration of like relay neurons into nuclei means that inactivating or stimulating them can efficiently test the functions of the circuits. Recent studies implementing these principles have revealed pathways through the thalamus that contribute to generating movements and to monitoring one’s own actions (corollary discharge).",

Meanwhile, deep-learning artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on bio-inspired models of purely cortical circuits have achieved surprising success solving sophisticated cognitive problems associated historically with human intelligence. Nevertheless, the limitations and shortcomings of artificial intelligence (AI) based on such ANNs are becoming increasingly clear. This review considers how the addition of thalamocortical connectivity and its putative functions related to cortical attention might address some of those shortcomings.

			"abstract": "The thalamus plays a crucial role in higher-order emergent functions of the brain, including working memory, attention and conscious awareness. How this small subcortical structure supports these crucial capacities remains poorly understood. In this manuscript, I argue that the connections between the thalamus and the superior colliculus, along with their topological location within the broader systems-level circuitry of the brain, play a crucial role in shaping complex, adaptive dynamics. Through these connections, the superior colliculus is proposed to mediate conscious awareness of highly-valued sensory phenomena, and hence, to maximise the adaptive nature of subsequent actions engaged by the networks of the ventral tier of the thalamus.

			"abstract": "How is the cerebellum capable of efficient motor learning and control despite very low firing of the inferior olive (IO) inputs, which are postulated to carry errors needed for learning and contribute to on-line motor control? IO neurons form the largest electrically coupled network in the adult human brain. Here, we discuss how intermediate coupling strengths can lead to chaotic resonance and increase information transmission of the error signal despite the very low IO firing rate. This increased information transmission can then lead to more efficient learning than with weak or strong coupling. In addition, we argue that a dynamic modulation of IO electrical coupling via the Purkinje cell-deep cerebellar neurons – IO triangle could speed up learning and improve on-line control. Initially strong coupling would allow transmission of large errors to multiple functionally related Purkinje cells, resulting in fast but coarse learning as well as significant effects on deep cerebellar nucleus and on-line motor control. In the late phase of learning decreased coupling would allow desynchronized IO firing, allowing high-fidelity transmission of error, resulting in slower but fine learning, and little on-line motor control effects.",

A major function of cerebellum is to fine tune the body movements with precision and are comparative to capabilities of artificial neural network. Several studies have focused on encoding the real-world information to neuronal responses but temporal information was not given due importance. Spiking neural network accounts to conversion of temporal information into the adaptive learning process. In this study, cerebellum like network was reconstructed which encodes spatial information to kinematic parameters, self-optimized by learning patterns as seen in rat cerebellum. Learning rules were incorporated into our model. Performance of the model was compared to an optimal control model and have evaluated the role of bioinspired models in representing inverse kinematics through applications to a low cost robotic arm developed at the lab. Artificial neural network of Kawato was used to compare with our existing model because of their similarity to biological circuit as seen in a real brain. Kawato's paired forward inverse model has used to train for fast movement based tasks which resembles human based motor tasks. Result suggest kinematics of a 6 DOF robotic arm was internally represented and this may have potential application in neuroprosthesis.",

			"abstract": "In this study, we utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine which brain regions contribute to feedback and feedforward motor control processes. Several studies have investigated the contributions of cortical and subcortical brain regions to motor performance by independently varying factors such as movement rate, force, and speed, and observing the neural responses. Such studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of neural coding of movement variables. Under natural movement conditions, however, these factors interact in a complex manner to produce differing performance levels. In the current investigation, we induced performance changes in a less constrained way, by having subjects move a joystick to hit targets of differing sizes on an LCD screen. These parametric changes in target size resulted in the well-known speed–accuracy tradeoff effect, allowing us to examine the brain regions responsive to global shifts in motor performance levels. That is, movements made to larger targets relied more on feedforward control whereas movements made to smaller targets relied more on feedback control. Using functional MRI, we identified two sets of brain regions in which activation was modulated with task difficulty. Areas exhibiting activation that was positively correlated with increasing target size included primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and the basal ganglia, regions that are typically classified as playing a role in force control and movement planning. Brain regions whose activation was negatively correlated with increasing target size included the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, multiple cerebellar regions, and the thalamus. These areas contributed to motor performance under higher levels of task difficulty. The results elucidate cortical and subcortical brain regions that are responsive to global shifts in motor performance, reflecting changes along the continuum of feedforward and feedback motor control.",

The problem with low feedback gain controlled robots is that the accuracy of the task execution is potentially low. In this paper we investigate if trajectory optimization of feedback-feedforward controlled robots improves their accuracy. For rest-to-rest motions, we find the optimal trajectory indirectly by numerically optimizing the corresponding feedforward controller for accuracy. A new performance measure called the Manipulation Sensitivity Norm (MSN) is introduced that determines the accuracy under most disturbances and modeling errors. We tested this method on a two DOF robotic arm in the horizontal plane. The results show that for all feedback gains we tested, the choice for the trajectory has a significant influence on the accuracy of the arm (viz. position errors being reduced from 2.5 cm to 0.3 cm). Moreover, to study which features of feedforward controllers cause high or low accuracy, four more feedforward controllers were tested. Results from those experiments indicate that a trajectory that is smooth or quickly approaches the goal position will be accurate.",

However, humans show highly stereotyped trajectories in which velocity profiles of both the eye and hand are smooth and symmetric for brief movements3,4. Here we present a unifying theory of eye and arm movements based on the single physiological assumption that the neural control signals are corrupted by noise whose variance increases with the size of the control signal. We propose that in the presence of such signal-dependent noise, the shape of a trajectory is selected to minimize the variance of the final eye or arm position. This minimum-variance theory accurately predicts the trajectories of both saccades and arm movements and the speed–accuracy trade-off described by Fitt's law5. These profiles are robust to changes in the dynamics of the eye or arm, as found empirically6,7. Moreover, the relation between path curvature and hand velocity during drawing movements reproduces the empirical ‘two-thirds power law’8,9. This theory provides a simple and powerful unifying perspective for both eye and arm movement control.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum is a major motor structure. However, in humans, its efferent topographical organization remains controversial and indirectly inferred from neuroimaging and animal studies. Even central questions such as ‘Can we evoke limb movements by stimulating the cerebellar cortex?’ have no clear answer. To address this issue, we electrically stimulated the posterior cerebellum of 20 human patients undergoing surgery for tumours located outside this structure (e.g. pineal gland, quadrigeminal plate). Stimulation, delivered at a 60-Hz frequency for 2 s, evoked focal (single-joint) ipsilateral movements. Different regions were associated with the production of head (vermal lobule VI), face/mouth (hemispheric lobule VI) and lower-limb (hemispheric lobules VIIb–IX) responses. Upper-limb representations were more widely distributed. They intermingled with face/mouth representations in the superior posterior cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI) and lower-limb representations in the inferior posterior cerebellum (hemispheric lobules VIIb–IX). No intra- or inter-limb somatotopy was found in these areas. Functionally, upper-limb (face/mouth movements) and upper limb–lower limb postural coordinations are major elements of our motor repertoire. Representation of these pairs of segments in common regions might favour the production of integrated motor behaviours. The intermediate region of the posterior cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VII and vermal lobules VII–VIII) was mostly silent. Latency results in conjunction with previous electrophysiological evidence in animals suggest that electrically evoked motor responses were not mediated by a cortical route but rather by brainstem structures. The potential role of this descending efferent pathway for fine motor control is discussed.",

			"abstract": "Action–feedback monitoring is essential to ensure meaningful interactions with the external world. This process involves generating efference copy-based sensory predictions and comparing these with the actual action-feedback. As neural correlates of comparator processes, previous fMRI studies have provided heterogeneous results, including the cerebellum, angular and middle temporal gyrus. However, these studies usually comprised only self-generated actions. Therefore, they might have induced not only action-based prediction errors, but also general sensory mismatch errors. Here, we aimed to disentangle these processes using a custom-made fMRI-compatible movement device, generating active and passive hand movements with identical sensory feedback. Online visual feedback of the hand was presented with a variable delay. Participants had to judge whether the feedback was delayed. Activity in the right cerebellum correlated more positively with delay in active than in passive trials. Interestingly, we also observed activation in the angular and middle temporal gyri, but across both active and passive conditions. This suggests that the cerebellum is a comparator area specific to voluntary action, whereas angular and middle temporal gyri seem to detect more general intersensory conflict. Correlations with behavior and cerebellar activity nevertheless suggest involvement of these temporoparietal areas in processing and awareness of temporal discrepancies in action-feedback monitoring.",

			"abstract": "The extent to which the spinal stretch reflex is involved in normal motor control and the contribution of monosynaptic Ia connections in its generation are not yet completely clarified. Regardless of these uncertainties, there is continuing interest in the reflex connections of the primary endings of muscle spindles, as detailed below.Muscle synergies laid down in the spinal cordThe execution of even the simplest movement involves a large number of muscles, but the pattern of muscle activity is consistent for any given type of movement (see Illert, 1996). Beevor (1904, cited by Illert, 1996) claimed that the neuronal arrangements for stereotyped movements are laid down in the spinal cord. The various muscle synergies could thus be represented by different sets of spinal connections, which have been termed ‘spinal functional units’ (Baldissera, Hultborn &amp; Illert, 1981), and are thought to be mobilised during voluntary movements, as was postulated long ago by Forster (1879, cited by Hultborn, 2001). One objective in the study of reflexes is to identify the pattern of connections underlying a particular form of behaviour. This entails tracing the effects of a given input to see how widely it is distributed to excite or inhibit different neurones. The classical example of such a study was provided by Sherrington (1910), who detailed the muscles that contract or relax in the flexor reflex (see Chapter 9).",

Reinforcement Learning (RL) associates these processes with three major classes of strategies for action selection: exploratory RL learns state-action values by exploration, model-based RL uses internal models to simulate future states reached by hypothetical actions and motor-memory RL selects past successful state-action mapping. In order to investigate the neural substrates that implement these strategies, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment while humans performed a sequential action selection task under conditions that promoted the use of a specific RL strategy. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum increased activity in the exploratory condition; the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial striatum and lateral cerebellum in the model-based condition; and the supplementary motor area, putamen and anterior cerebellum in the motor-memory condition. These findings suggest that a distinct prefrontal-basal ganglia and cerebellar network implements the model-based RL action selection strategy.",

			"abstract": "Contrary to forward biomechanical functions, which are deterministic, inverse biomechanical functions are generally not. Calculating an inverse biomechanical function is an ill-posed problem, which has no unique solution for a manipulator with several degrees of freedom. Studies of the command and control of biological movements suggest that the cerebellum takes part in the computation of approximate inverse functions, and this ability can control fast movements by predicting the consequence of current motor command. Limb movements toward a goal are defined as fast if they last less than the total duration of the processing and transmission delays in the motor and sensory pathways. Because of these delays, fast movements cannot be continuously controlled in a closed loop by use of sensory signals. Thus, fast movements must be controlled by some open loop controller, of which cerebellar pathways constitute an important part. This article presents a system-level fuzzy neuronal motor control circuit, inspired by the cerebellar pathways. The cerebellar cortex (CC) is assumed to embed internal models of the biomechanical functions of the limb segments. Such neural models are able to predict the consequences of motor commands and issue predictive signals encoding movement variables, which are sent to the controller via internal feedback loops. Differences between desired and expected values of variables of movements are calculated in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). After motor learning, the whole circuit can approximate the inverse function of the biomechanical function of a limb and acts as a controller. In this research, internal models of direct biomechanical functions are learned and embedded in the connectivity of the cerebellar pathways. Two fuzzy neural networks represent the two parts of the cerebellum, and an online gradual learning drives the acquisition of the internal models in CC and the controlling rules in DCN. As during real learning, exercise and repetition increase skill and speed. The learning procedure is started by a simple and slow movement, controlled in the presence of delays by a simple closed loop controller comparable to the spinal reflexes. The speed of the movements is then increased gradually, and output error signals are used to compute teaching signals and drive learning. Repetition of movements at each speed level allows to properly set the two neural networks, and progressively learn the movement. Finally, conditions of stability of the proposed model as an inverter are identified. Next, the control of a single segment arm, moved by two muscles, is simulated. After proper setting by motor learning, the circuit is able to reject perturbations.",

			"abstract": "In all vertebrates, excitatory spinal interneurons execute dynamic adjustments in the timing and amplitude of locomotor movements. Currently, it is unclear whether interneurons responsible for timing control are distinct from those involved in amplitude control. Here, we show that in larval zebrafish, molecularly, morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct types of V2a neurons exhibit complementary patterns of connectivity. Stronger higher-order connections from type I neurons to other excitatory V2a and inhibitory V0d interneurons provide timing control, while stronger last-order connections from type II neurons to motor neurons provide amplitude control. Thus, timing and amplitude are coordinated by distinct interneurons distinguished not by their occupation of hierarchically-arranged anatomical layers, but rather by differences in the reliability and probability of higher-order and last-order connections that ultimately form a single anatomical layer. These findings contribute to our understanding of the origins of timing and amplitude control in the spinal cord.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum integrates descending motor commands and sensory information to generate predictions and detect errors during ongoing behaviors. Cerebellar computation has been proposed to control motor but also non-motor behaviors, including reward expectation and cognitive flexibility. However, the organization and functional contribution of cerebellar output channels are incompletely understood. Here, we elaborate the cell-type specificity of a broad connectivity matrix from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) to the dorsal striatum in mice. Cerebello-striatal connections arise from all deep cerebellar subnuclei and are relayed through intralaminar thalamic nuclei (ILN). In the dorsal striatum, these connections target medium spiny neurons, but also ChAT-positive interneurons, a class of tonically active interneurons implicated in shifting and updating behavioral strategies. Chemogenetic silencing of cerebello-striatal connectivity modifies function of striatal ChAT-positive interneurons. We propose that cerebello-striatal connections relay cerebellar computation to striatal circuits for goal-directed behaviors.",

			"abstract": "Locomotion empowers animals to move. Locomotor-initiating signals from the brain are funneled through descending neurons in the brainstem that act directly on spinal locomotor circuits. Little is known in mammals about which spinal circuits are targeted by the command and how this command is transformed into rhythmicity in the cord. Here we address these questions leveraging a mouse brainstem-spinal cord preparation from either sex that allows locating the locomotor command neurons with simultaneous Ca2+ imaging of spinal neurons. We show that a restricted brainstem area – encompassing the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) and caudal ventrolateral reticular nucleus (CVL) – contains glutamatergic neurons which directly initiate locomotion. Ca2+ imaging captures the direct LPGi/CVL locomotor initiating command in the spinal cord and visualizes spinal glutamatergic modules that execute the descending command and its transformation into rhythmic locomotor activity. Inhibitory spinal networks are recruited in a distinctly different pattern. Our study uncovers the principal logic of how spinal circuits implement the locomotor command using a distinct modular organization.",

This has led to increasing efforts to develop and employ mathematical models to study the emergent properties of such systems. Conversely, the development of such models tends to reveal shortcomings in the experimental database upon which models must be constructed and validated. In both cases models are most useful when they point up discrepancies between what we think we know and possibilities that we may have overlooked. This overview considers those components of complete sensorimotor systems that currently appear to be potentially important but poorly understood.

			"abstract": "Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord restores locomotion in animal models of spinal cord injury but is less effective in humans. Here we hypothesized that this interspecies discrepancy is due to interference between EES and proprioceptive information in humans. Computational simulations and preclinical and clinical experiments reveal that EES blocks a significant amount of proprioceptive input in humans, but not in rats. This transient deafferentation prevents modulation of reciprocal inhibitory networks involved in locomotion and reduces or abolishes the conscious perception of leg position. Consequently, continuous EES can only facilitate locomotion within a narrow range of stimulation parameters and is unable to provide meaningful locomotor improvements in humans without rehabilitation. Simulations showed that burst stimulation and spatiotemporal stimulation profiles mitigate the cancellation of proprioceptive information, enabling robust control over motor neuron activity. This demonstrates the importance of stimulation protocols that preserve proprioceptive information to facilitate walking with EES.",

Our system models two extensively studied human visual capabilities: (1) extracting the \"gist\" of a scene to produce a coarse localization hypothesis, and (2) refining it by locating salient landmark regions in the scene. Gist is computed here as a holistic statistical signature of the image, yielding abstract scene classification and layout. Saliency is computed as a measure of interest at every image location, efficiently directing the time-consuming landmark identification process towards the most likely candidate locations in the image. The gist and salient landmark features are then further processed using a Monte-Carlo localization algorithm to allow the robot to generate its position. We test the system in three different outdoor environments - building complex (126times180 ft. area, 3794 testing images), vegetation-filled park (270times360 ft. area, 7196 testing images), and open-field park (450times585 ft. area, 8287 testing images) - each with its own challenges. The system is able to localize, on average, within 6.0, 10.73, and 32.24 ft., respectively, even with multiple kidnapped-robot instances.",

			"abstract": "A plethora of motor control challenges are presented to the oculomotor system whose primary purpose is to point the eyes to hold images stably on the fovea, the region of the retina with the highest visual acuity. The eyes can rotate in horizontal, vertical, and torsional (around the axis of gaze) directions and require the coordinated action of a total of 12 extraocular muscles. In addition, the eyes are mounted in a head that has the ability to move in roll, pitch, and yaw axes in addition to the ability to translate from side to side, and fore and aft. Positioned on the top of the body, the head is carried through three-dimensional space. Therefore, if the oculomotor system cannot solve this litany of stabilization problems, blurred, moving, or double images are presented to the visual system. Many portions of the cerebral cortex and brain stem have been committed to carry out this complex system control problem. We use a layered approach to understand the oculomotor system starting with the extraocular muscles, and working backward into the brain stem and eventually the cerebral cortex. Particular attention is devoted to control of voluntary saccades, smooth pursuit, and vergence. The longstanding dispute that was raised more than 150years ago between Hermann von Helmholtz and Ewald Hering on whether the central nervous system synthesizes signals that control the eyes together or individually is addressed. A number of clinical applications are provided to amplify the understanding of the anatomy and neurophysiology of eye movement control.",

			"abstract": "Imaging of the cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei and their connectivity are gaining attraction, due to the important role the cerebellum plays in cognition and motor control. Atlases of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei are used to locate regions of interest in clinical and neuroscience studies. However, the white matter that connects these relay stations is of at least similar functional importance. Damage to these cerebellar white matter tracts may lead to serious language, cognitive and emotional disturbances, although the pathophysiological mechanism behind it is still debated. Differences in white matter integrity between patients and controls might shed light on structure–function correlations. A probabilistic parcellation atlas of the cerebellar white matter would help these studies by facilitating automatic segmentation of the cerebellar peduncles, the localization of lesions and the comparison of white matter integrity between patients and controls. In this work a digital three-dimensional probabilistic atlas of the cerebellar white matter is presented, based on high quality 3T, 1.25mm resolution diffusion MRI data from 90 subjects participating in the Human Connectome Project. The white matter tracts were estimated using probabilistic tractography. Results over 90 subjects were symmetrical and trajectories of superior, middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles resembled the anatomy as known from anatomical studies. This atlas will contribute to a better understanding of cerebellar white matter architecture. It may eventually aid in defining structure–function correlations in patients with cerebellar disorders.",

			"abstract": "Motor surround inhibition is the neural mechanism that selectively favors the contraction of target muscles and inhibits nearby muscles to prevent unwanted movements. This inhibition was previously reported at the onset of a movement, but not during a tonic contraction. Cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI) is reduced in active muscles during tonic activation; however, it has not been studied in the surround muscles. CBI was evaluated in the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) as the target muscle, and the abductor digiti minimi (ADM), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) as surround muscles during rest and tonic activation of FDI in fourteen subjects. Cerebellar stimulation was performed under MRI-guided neuronavigation targeting lobule VIII of the cerebellar hemisphere. Stimulus intensities for cerebellar stimulation were based on the resting motor cortex threshold (RMT) and adjusted for the depth difference between the cerebellar and motor cortices. We used 90% to 120% of adjusted RMT as the conditioning stimulus intensity during rest. The intensity that generated the best CBI at rest in the FDI was selected for use during tonic activation. During selective tonic activation of FDI, CBI was significantly reduced only for FDI but not for the surround muscles. Unconditioned MEP sizes were increased in all muscles during FDI tonic activation compared to rest, despite background EMG activity increasing only for the FDI., Our study suggests that the cerebellum may play an important role in selective tonic finger movement by reducing its inhibition in the motor cortex only for the relevant agonist muscle.",

			"abstract": "The study of patients to infer normal brain function has a long tradition in neurology and psychology. More recently, the motor system has been subject to quantitative and computational characterization. The purpose of this review is to argue that the lesion approach and theoretical motor control can mutually inform each other. Specifically, one may identify distinct motor control processes from computational models and map them onto specific deficits in patients. Here we review some of the impairments in motor control, motor learning and higher-order motor control in patients with lesions of the corticospinal tract, the cerebellum, parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the medial temporal lobe. We attempt to explain some of these impairments in terms of computational ideas such as state estimation, optimization, prediction, cost, and reward. We suggest that a function of the cerebellum is system identification: to build internal models that predict sensory outcome of motor commands and correct motor commands through internal feedback. A function of the parietal cortex is state estimation: to integrate the predicted proprioceptive and visual outcomes with sensory feedback to form a belief about how the commands affected the states of the body and the environment. A function of basal ganglia is related to optimal control: learning costs and rewards associated with sensory states and estimating the “cost-to-go” during execution of a motor task. Finally, functions of the primary and the premotor cortices are related to implementing the optimal control policy by transforming beliefs about proprioceptive and visual states, respectively, into motor commands.",

			"abstract": "Making predictions and validating the predictions against actual sensory information is thought to be one of the most fundamental functions of the nervous system. A growing body of evidence shows that the neural mechanisms controlling behavior, both in motor and non-motor domains, rely on prediction errors, the discrepancy between predicted and actual information. The cerebellum has been viewed as a key component of the motor system providing predictions about upcoming movements and receiving feedback about motor errors. Consequentially, studies of cerebellar function have focused on the motor domain with less consideration for the wider context in which movements are generated. However, motor learning experiments show that cognition makes important contributions to motor adaptation that involves the cerebellum. One of the more successful theoretical frameworks for understanding motor control and cerebellar function is the forward internal model which states that the cerebellum predicts the sensory consequences of the motor commands and is involved in computing sensory prediction errors by comparing the predictions to the sensory feedback. The forward internal model was applied and tested mainly for effector movements, raising the question whether cerebellar encoding of behavior reflects task performance measures associated with cognitive involvement. Electrophysiological studies based on pseudo-random tracking in monkeys show that the discharge of Purkinje cell, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, encodes predictive and feedback signals not only of the effector kinematics but also of task performance. The implications are that the cerebellum implements both effector and task performance forward models and the latter are consistent with the cognitive contributions observed during motor learning. The implications of these findings include insights into recent psychophysical observations on moving with reduced feedback and motor learning. The findings also support the cerebellum’s place in hierarchical generative models that work in concert to refine predictions about behavior and the world. Therefore, cerebellar representations bridge motor and non-motor domains and provide a better understanding of cerebellar function within the functional architecture of the brain.",

			"abstract": "This review examines the signals encoded in the discharge of cerebellar neurons during voluntary arm and hand movements, assessing the state of our knowledge and the implications for hypotheses of cerebellar function. The evidence for the representation of forces, joint torques, or muscle activity in the discharge of cerebellar neurons is limited, questioning the validity of theories that the cerebellum directly encodes the motor command. In contrast, kinematic parameters such as position, direction, and velocity are widely and robustly encoded in the activity of cerebellar neurons. These findings favor hypotheses that the cerebellum plans or controls movements in a kinematic framework, such as the proposal that the cerebellum provides a forward internal model. Error signals are needed for on-line correction and motor learning, and several hypotheses postulate the need for their representations in the cerebellum. Error signals have been described mostly in the complex spike discharge of Purkinje cells, but no consensus has emerged on the exact information signaled by complex spikes during limb movements. Newer studies suggest that simple spike firing may also encode error signals. Finally, Purkinje cells located more posterior and laterally in the cerebellar cortex and dentate neurons encode nonmotor, task-related signals such as visual cues. These results suggest that cerebellar neurons provide a complement of information about motor behaviors. We assert that additional single unit studies are needed using rich movement paradigms, given the power of this approach to directly test specific hypotheses about cerebellar function.",

As a consequence, the intrinsic properties of olivary neurons and the synaptic inputs that modify their output are critical for cerebellar function. In this chapter, all major issues relevant for the ultimate function of the olivocerebellar system are addressed. First, developmental aspects including the origin and migratory routes of the cell bodies of the inferior olivary neurons are described, followed by the organization of the olivary neurons into subnuclei, as well as the outgrowth of their axons into climbing fibers innervating Purkinje cells. Subsequently, a detailed description is provided of the ultrastructure of the olivary neuropil, which is characterized by the presence of dendrodendritic gap junctions located in glomeruli and by the ubiquitously combined excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs of their coupled spines. Furthermore, we describe the main electrophysiological properties of the olivary neurons, highlighting their propensity to oscillate and fire in synchrony at relatively low and stable frequencies. Finally, we review the most recent cellular and network models of the inferior olive, which indicate that this unique nucleus is well designed to control patterns of both rate coding and spatiotemporal coding, albeit for short durations. As a consequence, the abnormalities in their firing properties can contribute to syndromes such as tremor, palatomyoclonus, dystonia, ataxia, respiratory deficits, and possibly also autism.",

			"abstract": "Visuomotor coordination is a complex process involving several brain regions, primarily the cerebellum and motor cortex. Studies have shown inconsistent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) results in the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus of the cerebro-cerebellar connections. Echoing anatomical pathways, these two different cerebellar regions are differentially responsible for afferent and efferent cerebro-cerebellar functional connections. The aim of this study was to measure the baseline resting-state functional connectivity of different cerebellar afferent and efferent pathways and to investigate their relationship to visuomotor learning abilities. We used different cerebellar repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequencies before a pursuit rotor task to influence visuomotor performance. Thirty-eight right-handed participants were included and randomly assigned to three different rTMS frequency groups (1 Hz, 10 Hz and sham) and underwent baseline rsfMRI and pursuit rotor task assessments. We report that greater baseline functional connectivity in the afferent cerebro-cerebellar pathways was associated with greater accuracy improvements. Interestingly, lower baseline functional connectivity in the efferent dentato-thalamo-cortical pathways was associated with greater stability in visuomotor performance, possibly associated with the inhibitory role of the dentate nucleus and caused a reduction in the efferent functional connectivity. The functional dissociation of the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus and their connections, suggests that distinct mechanisms in the cerebellum regarding visuomotor learning, which should be investigated in future research.",

			"abstract": "Cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit a unique type of synaptic plasticity, namely, long-term depression (LTD). When two inputs to a Purkinje cell, one from a climbing fiber and the other from a set of granule cell axons, are repeatedly associated, the input efficacy of the granule cell axons in exciting the Purkinje cell is persistently depressed. Sectioni of this review briefly describes the history of research around LTD, and section ii specifies physiological characteristics of LTD. Sections iii and ivthen review the massive data accumulated during the past two decades, which have revealed complex networks of signal transduction underlying LTD. Section iii deals with a variety of first messengers, receptors, ion channels, transporters, G proteins, and phospholipases. Section iv covers second messengers, protein kinases, phosphatases and other elements, eventually leading to inactivation ofdl-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolone-propionate-selective glutamate receptors that mediate granule cell-to-Purkinje cell transmission. Section v defines roles of LTD in the light of the microcomplex concept of the cerebellum as functionally eliminating those synaptic connections associated with errors during repeated exercises, while preserving other connections leading to the successful execution of movements. Section vi examines the validity of this microcomplex concept based on the data collected from recent numerous studies of various forms of motor learning in ocular reflexes, eye-blink conditioning, posture, locomotion, and hand/arm movements. Section vii emphasizes the importance of integrating studies on LTD and learning and raises future possibilities of extending cerebellar research to reveal memory mechanisms of implicit learning in general.",

			"abstract": "The precision of skilled forelimb movement has long been presumed to rely on rapid feedback corrections triggered by internally directed copies of outgoing motor commands, but the functional relevance of inferred internal copy circuits has remained unclear. One class of spinal interneurons implicated in the control of mammalian forelimb movement, cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs), has the potential to convey an internal copy of premotor signals through dual innervation of forelimb-innervating motor neurons and precerebellar neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus. Here we examine whether the PN internal copy pathway functions in the control of goal-directed reaching. In mice, PNs include a genetically accessible subpopulation of cervical V2a interneurons, and their targeted ablation perturbs reaching while leaving intact other elements of forelimb movement. Moreover, optogenetic activation of the PN internal copy branch recruits a rapid cerebellar feedback loop that modulates forelimb motor neuron activity and severely disrupts reaching kinematics. Our findings implicate V2a PNs as the focus of an internal copy pathway assigned to the rapid updating of motor output during reaching behaviour.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum is normally assumed to represent ipsilateral movements. We tested this by making microelectrode penetrations into the deep cerebellar nuclei (mainly nucleus interpositus) of monkeys trained to perform a reach and grasp task with either hand. Following weak single electrical stimuli, many sites produced clear bilateral facilitation of multiple forelimb muscles. The short onset latencies, which were similar for each side, suggested that at least some of the muscle responses were mediated by descending tracts originating in the brainstem, rather than via the cerebral cortex. Additionally, cerebellar neurones modulated their discharge with both ipsilateral and contralateral movements. This was so, even when we carefully excluded contralateral trials with evidence of electromyogram modulation on the ipsilateral side. We conclude that the deep cerebellar nuclei have a bilateral movement representation, and relatively direct, powerful access to limb muscles on both sides of the body. This places the cerebellum in an ideal position to coordinate bilateral movements.",

			"abstract": "Anterior–posterior (AP) and posterior–anterior (PA) pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) appear to activate distinct interneuron networks that contribute differently to two varieties of physiological plasticity and motor behaviors (). The AP network is thought to be more sensitive to online manipulation of cerebellar (CB) activity using transcranial direct current stimulation. Here we probed CB–M1 interactions using cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI) in young healthy female and male individuals. TMS over the cerebellum produced maximal CBI of PA-evoked EMG responses at an interstimulus interval of 5 ms (PA-CBI), whereas the maximum effect on AP responses was at 7 ms (AP-CBI), suggesting that CB–M1 pathways with different conduction times interact with AP and PA networks. In addition, paired associative stimulation using ulnar nerve stimulation and PA TMS pulses over M1, a protocol used in human studies to induce cortical plasticity, reduced PA-CBI but not AP-CBI, indicating that cortical networks process cerebellar inputs in distinct ways. Finally, PA-CBI and AP-CBI were differentially modulated after performing two different types of motor learning tasks that are known to process cerebellar input in different ways. The data presented here are compatible with the idea that applying different TMS currents to the cerebral cortex may reveal cerebellar inputs to both the premotor cortex and M1. Overall, these results suggest that there are two independent CB–M1 networks that contribute uniquely to different motor behaviors., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Connections between the cerebellum and primary motor cortex (M1) are essential for performing daily life activities, as damage to these pathways can result in faulty movements. Therefore, developing and understanding novel approaches to probe this pathway are critical to advancing our understanding of the pathophysiology of diseases involving the cerebellum. Here, we show evidence for two distinct cerebellar–cerebral interactions using cerebellar stimulation in combination with directional transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over M1. These distinct cerebellar–cerebral interactions respond differently to physiological plasticity and to distinct motor learning tasks, which suggests they represent separate cerebellar inputs to the premotor cortex and M1. Overall, we show that directional TMS can probe two distinct cerebellar–cerebral pathways that likely contribute to independent processes of learning.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum has a medial, cortico-nuclear zone consisting of the cerebellar vermis and the fastigial nucleus. Functionally, this zone is concerned with whole-body posture and locomotion. The vermis classically is thought to be included within the “spinocerebellum” and to receive somatic sensory input from ascending spinal pathways. In contrast, the lateral zone of the cerebellum is included in the “cerebro-cerebellum” because it is densely interconnected with the cerebral cortex. Here we report the surprising result that a portion of the vermis receives dense input from the cerebral cortex. We injected rabies virus into lobules VB–VIIIB of the vermis and used retrograde transneuronal transport of the virus to define disynaptic inputs to it. We found that large numbers of neurons in the primary motor cortex and in several motor areas on the medial wall of the hemisphere project to the vermis. Thus, our results challenge the classical view of the vermis and indicate that it no longer should be considered as entirely isolated from the cerebral cortex. Instead, lobules VB–VIIIB represent a site where the cortical motor areas can influence descending control systems involved in the regulation of whole-body posture and locomotion. We argue that the projection from the cerebral cortex to the vermis is part of the neural substrate for anticipatory postural adjustments and speculate that dysfunction of this system may underlie some forms of dystonia.",

			"abstract": "The thalamus is the major source of cortical inputs shaping sensation, action and cognition. Thalamic circuits are targeted by two major inhibitory systems: the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and extra-thalamic inhibitory (ETI) inputs. A unifying framework of how these systems operate is currently lacking. Here, we propose that TRN circuits are specialized to exert thalamic control at different spatiotemporal scales. Local inhibition of thalamic spike rates prevails during attentional selection whereas global inhibition more likely during sleep. In contrast, the ETI (arising from basal ganglia, zona incerta, anterior pretectum and pontine reticular formation) provides temporally-precise and focal inhibition, impacting spike timing. Together, these inhibitory systems allow graded control of thalamic output, enabling thalamocortical operations to dynamically match ongoing behavioral demands.",

			"abstract": "Movements synchronized with external rhythms are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Despite the involvement of the cerebellum, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In monkeys performing synchronized saccades to periodically alternating visual stimuli, we found that neuronal activity in the cerebellar dentate nucleus correlated with the timing of the next saccade and the current temporal error. One-third of the neurons were active regardless of saccade direction and showed greater activity for synchronized than for reactive saccades. During the transition from reactive to predictive saccades in each trial, the activity of these neurons coincided with target onset, representing an internal model of rhythmic structure rather than a specific motor command. The behavioural changes induced by electrical stimulation were explained by activating different groups of neurons at various strengths, suggesting that the lateral cerebellum contains multiple functional modules for the acquisition of internal rhythms, predictive motor control, and error detection during synchronized movements.",

			"abstract": "Interactions from both inhibitory and excitatory interneurons are necessary components of cortical processing that contribute to the vast amount of motor actions executed by humans daily. As transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over primary motor cortex is capable of activating corticospinal neurons trans-synaptically, studies over the past 30 years have provided how subtle changes in stimulation parameters (i.e., current direction, pulse width, and paired-pulse) can elucidate evidence for two distinct neuronal networks that can be probed with this technique. This article provides a brief review of some fundamental studies demonstrating how these networks have separable excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons. Furthermore, the findings of recent investigations will be discussed in detail, illustrating how each network’s sensitivity to different brain states (i.e., rest, movement preparation, and motor learning) is dissociable. Understanding the physiological characteristics of each network can help to explain why interindividual responses to TMS exist, while also providing insights into the role of these networks in various human motor behaviors.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum funnels its entire output through a small number of presumed glutamatergic premotor projection neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei and GABAergic neurons that feed back to the inferior olive. Here we use transgenic mice selectively expressing green fluorescent protein in glycinergic neurons to demonstrate that many premotor output neurons in the medial cerebellar (fastigial) nuclei are in fact glycinergic, not glutamatergic as previously thought. These neurons exhibit similar firing properties as neighboring glutamatergic neurons and receive direct input from both Purkinje cells and excitatory fibers. Glycinergic fastigial neurons make functional projections to vestibular and reticular neurons in the ipsilateral brainstem, whereas their glutamatergic counterparts project contralaterally. Together, these data suggest that the cerebellum can influence motor outputs via two distinct and complementary pathways.",

Many hypotheses emphasize the role of the cerebellum in computing learned predictions important for sensorimotor calibration and feedforward control of movements.

This review describes evidence for corollary discharge inputs to the cerebellum and highlights the hypothesized roles for this information in cerebellar motor-related computations. Insights into the role of corollary discharge in motor control, described here, are intended to inform the exciting but still untested roles of corollary discharge in cognition, perception, and thought control relevant in psychiatric disorders.",

			"abstract": "We here provide neural evidence that the cerebellar circuit can predict future inputs from present outputs, a hallmark of an internal forward model. Recent computational studies hypothesize that the cerebellum performs state prediction known as a forward model. To test the forward-model hypothesis, we analyzed activities of 94 mossy fibers (inputs to the cerebellar cortex), 83 Purkinje cells (output from the cerebellar cortex to dentate nucleus), and 73 dentate nucleus cells (cerebellar output) in the cerebro-cerebellum, all recorded from a monkey performing step-tracking movements of the right wrist. We found that the firing rates of one population could be reconstructed as a weighted linear sum of those of preceding populations. We then went on to investigate if the current outputs of the cerebellum (dentate cells) could predict the future inputs of the cerebellum (mossy fibers). The firing rates of mossy fibers at time t + t1 could be well reconstructed from as a weighted sum of firing rates of dentate cells at time t, thereby proving that the dentate activities contained predictive information about the future inputs. The average goodness-of-fit (R2) decreased moderately from 0.89 to 0.86 when t1 was increased from 20 to 100 ms, hence indicating that the prediction is able to compensate the latency of sensory feedback. The linear equations derived from the firing rates resembled those of a predictor known as Kalman filter composed of prediction and filtering steps. In summary, our analysis of cerebellar activities supports the forward-model hypothesis of the cerebellum.",

			"abstract": "A long-standing question in neuroscience is how the brain controls movement that requires precisely timed muscle activations. Studies using Pavlovian delay eyeblink conditioning provide good insight into this question. In delay eyeblink conditioning, which is believed to involve the cerebellum, a subject learns an interstimulus interval (ISI) between the onsets of a conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone and an unconditioned stimulus such as an airpuff to the eye. After a conditioning phase, the subject’s eyes automatically close or blink when the ISI time has passed after CS onset. This timing information is thought to be represented in some way in the cerebellum. Several computational models of the cerebellum have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of time representation, and they commonly point to the granular layer network. This article will review these computational models and discuss the possible computational power of the cerebellum.",

			"abstract": "The inferior olive, which provides the climbing fibers to Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, has been implicated in various functions, such as learning and timing of movements, and comparing intended with achieved movements. For example, climbing-fiber activity could transmit error signals during eye-blink conditioning or adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, or it could carry motor command signals beating on the rhythm of the oscillating and synchronous firing of ensembles of olivary neurons, or both. In this review, we approach the controversial issue of olivocerebellar function from the perspective of the unique organization of the microcircuitry of the olivary neuropil. The characteristic glomeruli are formed by a core of long dendritic or axonal spines, each of which is innervated by both an inhibitory terminal derived from the hindbrain and an excitatory terminal derived from either an ascending or descending input. The dendritic spines, which originate from dendrites with varicosities carrying dendritic lamellar bodies, are coupled by gap junctions. By drawing a comparison with a computational model by Segev and Rall, which might be applicable to the typical olivary spine with its unique morphological features and combined excitatory and inhibitory input, we propose that the microcircuitry of the inferior olive is capable of functioning both in motor learning and motor timing, but does not directly compare intended with achieved movements.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum is involved in avoidance learning tasks, where anticipatory actions are developed to protect against aversive stimuli. In the execution and acquisition of discrete actions we can distinguish errors of omission and commission due to a failure to execute a required defensive Conditioned Response (CR) to avoid an aversive Unconditioned Stimulus (US), and the energy expenditure of triggering an unnecessary CR in the absence of a US respectively. Hence, a motor learning cost function must consider both these components of performance and energy expenditure. Unlike remaining noxious stimuli, unnecessary actions are not directly sensed by the cerebellum. It has been suggested that the Nucleo-Olivary Inhibition (NOI) serves to internally rely information about these needless protective actions. Here we argue that the function of the NOI can be interpreted in broader terms as a signal that is used to learn optimal actions in terms of cost. We work with a computational model of the cerebellum to address: (i) how can the optimum balance between remaining aversive stimuli and preventing effort be found, and (ii) how can the cerebellum use the overall cost information to establish this optimum balance through the adjusting of the gain of the NOI. In this paper we derive the value of the NOI that minimizes the overall cost and propose a learning rule for the cerebellum through which this value is reached. We test this rule in a collision avoidance task performed by a simulated robot.",

			"abstract": "Despite wide evidence suggesting anatomical and functional interactions between cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia, the learning processes operating within them --often viewed as respectively unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning-- are studied in isolation, neglecting their strong interdependence. We discuss how those brain areas form a highly integrated system combining different learning mechanisms into an effective super-learning process supporting the acquisition of flexible motor behaviour. The term “super-learning” does not indicate a new learning paradigm. Rather, it refers to the fact that different learning mechanisms act in synergy as they: (a) affect neural structures often relying on the widespread action of neuromodulators; (b) act within various stages of cortical/subcortical pathways that are organised in pipeline to support multiple sensation-to-action mappings operating at different levels of abstraction; (c) interact through the reciprocal influence of the output compartments of different brain structures, most notably in the cerebello-cortical and basal ganglia-cortical loops. Here we articulate this new hypothesis and discuss empirical evidence supporting it by specifically referring to motor adaptation and sequence learning.",

			"abstract": "Accumulating evidence points to a critical role for the human cerebellum in both motor and nonmotor behaviors. A core tenet of this new understanding of cerebellar function is the existence of functional subregions within the cerebellum that differentially support motor, cognitive, and affective behaviors. This cerebellar functional topography – based on converging evidence from neuroanatomic, neuroimaging, and clinical studies – is evident in both adult and pediatric populations. The sensorimotor homunculi in the anterior lobe and lobule VIII established in early tract tracing and electrophysiologic studies are evident in both task-based and resting-state human functional imaging studies. In patients, damage to the anterior cerebellum, extending into medial lobule VI, is associated with the cerebellar motor syndrome. The cerebellar posterior lobe, including vermal and hemispheric regions of lobules VI and VII, is reciprocally interconnected with cerebral association and paralimbic cortices. Resting-state and task-based neuroimaging studies show functional activation patterns in these regions during higher-level cognitive tasks, and lesions of the posterior cerebellum lead to the cerebellar cognitive affective/Schmahmann syndrome with its characteristic intellectual and emotional impairments. The existence of cerebellar connectional and functional topography provides the critical anatomic substrate for a cerebellar role in both motor and nonmotor functions. It also establishes a framework for interpreting cerebellar activation patterns, cognitive and behavioral outcomes following cerebellar damage, and the cerebellar structural and functional differences reported in a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

This approach entails the collection of large quantities of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from each individual subject. Studies employing precision functional mapping in the cerebral cortex have found that individuals manifest unique representations of functional brain networks around a central tendency described by previous group average approaches. We recently extended precision functional mapping to the subcortex and cerebellum, which has revealed several novel organizational principles within these structures. Here, we detail these principles and provide insights into how precision functional mapping of subcortical structures and the cerebellum may become clinically translatable.",

			"abstract": "In recent years, several studies have investigated upper-limb motion in a variety of scenarios including motor control, physiology, rehabilitation and industry. Such applications assess people's kinematics and muscular performances, focusing on typical movements that simulate daily-life tasks. However, often only a limited interpretation of the EMG patterns is provided. In fact, rarely the assessments separate phasic (movement-related) and tonic (postural) EMG components, as well as the EMG in the acceleration and deceleration phases. With this paper, we provide a comprehensive and detailed characterization of the activity of upper-limb and trunk muscles in healthy people point-to-point upper limb movements. Our analysis includes in-depth muscle activation magnitude assessment, separation of phasic (movement-related) and tonic (postural) EMG activations, directional tuning, distinction between activations in the acceleration and deceleration phases. Results from our study highlight a predominant postural activity with respect to movement related muscular activity. The analysis based on the acceleration phase sheds light on finer motor control strategies, highlighting the role of each muscle in the acceleration and deceleration phase. The results of this study are applicable to several research fields, including physiology, rehabilitation, design of robots and assistive solutions, exoskeletons.",

			"abstract": "When animals walk overground, mechanical stimuli activate various receptors located in muscles, joints, and skin. Afferents from these mechanoreceptors project to neuronal networks controlling locomotion in the spinal cord and brain. The dynamic interactions between the control systems at different levels of the neuraxis ensure that locomotion adjusts to its environment and meets task demands. In this article, we describe and discuss the essential contribution of somatosensory feedback to locomotion. We start with a discussion of how biomechanical properties of the body affect somatosensory feedback. We follow with the different types of mechanoreceptors and somatosensory afferents and their activity during locomotion. We then describe central projections to locomotor networks and the modulation of somatosensory feedback during locomotion and its mechanisms. We then discuss experimental approaches and animal models used to investigate the control of locomotion by somatosensory feedback before providing an overview of the different functional roles of somatosensory feedback for locomotion. Lastly, we briefly describe the role of somatosensory feedback in the recovery of locomotion after neurological injury. We highlight the fact that somatosensory feedback is an essential component of a highly integrated system for locomotor control. © 2021 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 11:1-71, 2021.",

However, the functional contribution of glutamatergic GRN neurons in initiating, maintaining, and stopping locomotion is still unclear. Combining electromyographic recordings with optogenetic manipulations in freely behaving mice, we investigate the functional contribution of glutamatergic brainstem neurons of the GRN to motor and locomotor activity. Short-pulse photostimulation of one side of the glutamatergic GRN did not elicit locomotion but evoked distinct motor responses in flexor and extensor muscles at rest and during locomotion. Glutamatergic GRN outputs to the spinal cord appear to be gated according to the spinal locomotor network state. Increasing the duration of photostimulation increased motor and postural tone at rest and reset locomotor rhythm during ongoing locomotion. In contrast, photoinhibition impaired locomotor pattern and rhythm. We conclude that unilateral activation of glutamatergic GRN neurons triggered motor activity and modified ongoing locomotor pattern and rhythm.",

However, because of technical difficulties, the rate of progress in defining the intrinsic properties of mammalian locomotor rhythm generators has been slow in comparison to that made in the study of such networks in lower vertebrates. Investigations on afferent and descending control of locomotor activity in mammals have demonstrated that many of these pathways interact with the rhythm generator. In this review we discuss how these interactions (resetting) can be used for outlining relevant spinal circuits as a basis for a future identification of individual neurons of the spinal locomotor networks. In this overview we have given particular emphasis to selected afferent systems to illustrate the possibilities and problems with this approach.",

			"abstract": "Voluntary movements are driven by coordinated activity across a large population of motor cortical neurons. Formation of this activity is controlled by local interactions and long-range inputs. How remote areas of the brain communicate with motor cortical neurons to effectively drive movement remains unclear. We address this question by studying the cerebellar-thalamocortical system. We find that thalamic input to the motor cortex triggers feedforward inhibition by contacting inhibitory cells via highly effective GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors and that, during task performance, the activity of parvalbumin (PV) and pyramidal cells exhibits relations comparable with movement parameters. We also find that the movement-related activity of PV interneurons precedes firing of pyramidal cells. This counterintuitive sequence of events, where inhibitory cells are recruited more strongly and before excitatory cells, may amplify the cortical effect of cerebellar signals in a way that exceeds their sheer synaptic efficacy by suppressing other inputs.",

The cerebellum and thalamus are two key areas involved in shaping cortical output and movement, but the contribution of a cerebellar-thalamocortical pathway to voluntary movement initiation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how an auditory “go cue” transforms thalamocortical activity patterns and how these changes relate to movement initiation. Population responses in dentate/interpositus-recipient regions of motor thalamus reflect a time-locked increase in activity immediately prior to movement initiation that is temporally uncoupled from the go cue, indicative of a fixed-latency feedforward motor timing signal. Blocking cerebellar or motor thalamic output suppresses movement initiation, while stimulation triggers movements in a behavioral context-dependent manner.

			"abstract": "The cerebellum has long been known to play an important role in motor and balance control, and accumulating evidence has revealed that it is also involved in multiple cognitive functions. However, the evidence from neuroimaging studies and clinical observations is not well-integrated at the anatomical or molecular level. The goal of this review is to summarize and link different aspects of the cerebellum, including molecular patterning, functional topography images, and clinical cerebellar disorders. More specifically, we explored the potential relationships between the cerebrocerebellar connections and the expression of particular molecules and, in particular, zebrin stripe (a Purkinje cell-specific antibody molecular marker, which is a glycolytic enzyme expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells). We hypothesized that the zebrin patterns contribute to cerebellar functional maps—especially when cerebrocerebellar circuit changes exist in cerebellar-related diseases. The zebrin stripe receives input from climbing fibers and project to different parts of the cerebral cortex through its cerebrocerebellar connection. Since zebrin-positive cerebellar Purkinje cells are resistant to excitotoxicity and cell injury while zebrin-negative zones are more prone to damage, we suggest that motor control dysfunction symptoms such as ataxia and dysmetria present earlier and are easier to observe than non-ataxia symptoms due to zebrin-negative cell damage by cerebrocerebellar connections. In summary, we emphasize that the molecular zebrin patterns provide the basis for a new viewpoint from which to investigate cerebellar functions and clinico-neuroanatomic correlations.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellar vermis, long associated with axial motor control, has been implicated in a surprising range of neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive and affective functions. Remarkably little is known, however, about the specific cell types and neural circuits responsible for these diverse functions. Here, using single-cell gene expression profiling and anatomical circuit analyses of vermis output neurons in the mouse fastigial (medial cerebellar) nucleus, we identify five major classes of glutamatergic projection neurons distinguished by gene expression, morphology, distribution, and input-output connectivity. Each fastigial cell type is connected with a specific set of Purkinje cells and inferior olive neurons and in turn innervates a distinct collection of downstream targets. Transsynaptic tracing indicates extensive disynaptic links with cognitive, affective, and motor forebrain circuits. These results indicate that diverse cerebellar vermis functions are mediated by modular synaptic connections of distinct fastigial cell types which differentially coordinate posturomotor, oromotor, positional-autonomic, orienting, and vigilance circuits.",

			"abstract": "Motor thalamus (Mthal) is implicated in the control of movement because it is strategically located between motor areas of the cerebral cortex and motor-related subcortical structures, such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia (BG). The role of BG and cerebellum in motor control has been extensively studied but how Mthal processes inputs from these two networks is unclear. Specifically, there is considerable debate about the role of BG inputs on Mthal activity. This review summarizes anatomical and physiological knowledge of the Mthal and its afferents and reviews current theories of Mthal function by discussing the impact of cortical, BG and cerebellar inputs on Mthal activity. One view is that Mthal activity in BG and cerebellar-receiving territories is primarily “driven” by glutamatergic inputs from the cortex or cerebellum, respectively, whereas BG inputs are modulatory and do not strongly determine Mthal activity. This theory is steeped in the assumption that the Mthal processes information in the same way as sensory thalamus, through interactions of modulatory inputs with a single driver input. Another view, from BG models, is that BG exert primary control on the BG-receiving Mthal so it effectively relays information from BG to cortex. We propose a new “super-integrator” theory where each Mthal territory processes multiple driver or driver-like inputs (cortex and BG, cortex and cerebellum), which are the result of considerable integrative processing. Thus, BG and cerebellar Mthal territories assimilate motivational and proprioceptive motor information previously integrated in cortico-BG and cortico-cerebellar networks, respectively, to develop sophisticated motor signals that are transmitted in parallel pathways to cortical areas for optimal generation of motor programmes. Finally, we briefly review the pathophysiological changes that occur in the BG in parkinsonism and generate testable hypotheses about how these may affect processing of inputs in the Mthal.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellar nuclei, and to some extent the vestibular nuclei, mediate the ultimate result of cerebellar processing to the rest of the brain. Cerebellar output is directed to the diencephalon and to a score of brainstem regions. This chapter reviews the cerebellar nuclear projections to the brainstem areas that give rise to descending connections that can influence motor programming at spinal cord level, i.e., the reticulospinal, vestibulospinal, rubrospinal, tectospinal, and interstitiospinal pathways. In addition, cerebellar projections to other areas will be briefly considered. Although cerebellar output is structured by the modular internal organization of cerebellar circuitry and related olivocerebellar connections, it is concluded that the modular output, i.e., output of individual cerebellar nuclei or parts thereof, still reaches many areas in the brainstem and diencephalon. In addition, multiple modules may converge their outputs indirectly to the same muscles. This suggests that multiple modules may each take part in different aspects of control of the same muscle or muscle group. Conversely, individual modules, due to the distributed nature of their outputs, may simultaneously affect several descending motor systems with the same ensuing goal. Tools for detailed anatomical and physiological studies are now available and are expected to enhance our knowledge on the effects of the cerebellum on descending motor pathways.",

			"abstract": "Key points Purkinje cells in the cerebellum integrate input from sensory organs with that from premotor centres. Purkinje cells use a variety of sensory inputs relaying information from the environment to modify motor control. Here we investigated to what extent the climbing fibre inputs to Purkinje cells signal mono- or multi-sensory information, and to what extent this signalling is subject to recent history of activity. We show that individual climbing fibres convey multiple types of sensory information, together providing a rich mosaic projection pattern of sensory signals across the cerebellar cortex. Moreover, firing probability of climbing fibres following sensory stimulation depends strongly on the recent history of activity, showing a tendency to homeostatic dampening. Abstract Cerebellar Purkinje cells integrate sensory information with motor efference copies to adapt movements to behavioural and environmental requirements. They produce complex spikes that are triggered by the activity of climbing fibres originating in neurons of the inferior olive. These complex spikes can shape the onset, amplitude and direction of movements and the adaptation of such movements to sensory feedback. Clusters of nearby inferior olive neurons project to parasagittally aligned stripes of Purkinje cells, referred to as ‘microzones’. It is currently unclear to what extent individual Purkinje cells within a single microzone integrate climbing fibre inputs from multiple sources of different sensory origins, and to what extent sensory-evoked climbing fibre responses depend on the strength and recent history of activation. Here we imaged complex spike responses in cerebellar lobule crus 1 to various types of sensory stimulation in awake mice. We find that different sensory modalities and receptive fields have a mild, but consistent, tendency to converge on individual Purkinje cells, with climbing fibres showing some degree of input-specificity. Purkinje cells encoding the same stimulus show increased events with coherent complex spike firing and tend to lie close together. Moreover, whereas complex spike firing is only mildly affected by variations in stimulus strength, it depends strongly on the recent history of climbing fibre activity. Our data point towards a mechanism in the olivo-cerebellar system that regulates complex spike firing during mono- or multi-sensory stimulation around a relatively low set-point, highlighting an integrative coding scheme of complex spike firing under homeostatic control.",

			"abstract": "The compartmentalization of the cerebellum into modules is often used to discuss its function. What, exactly, can be considered a module, how do they operate, can they be subdivided and do they act individually or in concert are only some of the key questions discussed in this consensus paper. Experts studying cerebellar compartmentalization give their insights on the structure and function of cerebellar modules, with the aim of providing an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on this subject. Starting with an historical perspective indicating that the basis of the modular organization is formed by matching olivocorticonuclear connectivity, this is followed by consideration of anatomical and chemical modular boundaries, revealing a relation between anatomical, chemical, and physiological borders. In addition, the question is asked what the smallest operational unit of the cerebellum might be. Furthermore, it has become clear that chemical diversity of Purkinje cells also results in diversity of information processing between cerebellar modules. An additional important consideration is the relation between modular compartmentalization and the organization of the mossy fiber system, resulting in the concept of modular plasticity. Finally, examination of cerebellar output patterns suggesting cooperation between modules and recent work on modular aspects of emotional behavior are discussed. Despite the general consensus that the cerebellum has a modular organization, many questions remain. The authors hope that this joint review will inspire future cerebellar research so that we are better able to understand how this brain structure makes its vital contribution to behavior in its most general form.",

			"abstract": "The cerebellum is involved in many motor, autonomic and cognitive functions, and new tasks that have a cerebellar contribution are discovered on a regular basis. Simultaneously, our insight into the functional compartmentalization of the cerebellum has markedly improved. Additionally, studies on cerebellar output pathways have seen a renaissance due to the development of viral tracing techniques. To create an overview of the current state of our understanding of cerebellar efferents, we undertook a systematic review of all studies on monosynaptic projections from the cerebellum to the brainstem and the diencephalon in mammals. This revealed that important projections from the cerebellum, to the motor nuclei, cerebral cortex, and basal ganglia, are predominantly di- or polysynaptic, rather than monosynaptic. Strikingly, most target areas receive cerebellar input from all three cerebellar nuclei, showing a convergence of cerebellar information at the output level. Overall, there appeared to be a large level of agreement between studies on different species as well as on the use of different types of neural tracers, making the emerging picture of the cerebellar output areas a solid one. Finally, we discuss how this cerebellar output network is affected by a range of diseases and syndromes, with also non-cerebellar diseases having impact on cerebellar output areas.",

			"abstract": "The red nucleus (RN) is a large subcortical structure located in the ventral midbrain. Although it originated as a primitive relay between the cerebellum and the spinal cord, during its phylogenesis the RN shows a progressive segregation between a magnocellular part, involved in the rubrospinal system, and a parvocellular part, involved in the olivocerebellar system. Despite exhibiting distinct evolutionary trajectories, these two regions are strictly tied together and play a prominent role in motor and non-motor behavior in different animal species. However, little is known about their function in the human brain. This lack of knowledge may have been conditioned both by the notable differences between human and non-human RN and by inherent difficulties in studying this structure directly in the human brain, leading to a general decrease of interest in the last decades. In the present review, we identify the crucial issues in the current knowledge and summarize the results of several decades of research about the RN, ranging from animal models to human diseases. Connecting the dots between morphology, experimental physiology and neuroimaging, we try to draw a comprehensive overview on RN functional anatomy and bridge the gap between basic and translational research.",

			"abstract": "While the cerebellum has traditionally been thought of as mainly involved in motor functions, evidence has been accumulating for cerebellar contributions also to non-motor, cognitive functions. The notion of a cerebellar internal model underlying prediction and processing of sensory events and coordination and fine-tuning of appropriate responses has put the cerebellum right at the interface of motor behavior and cognition. Along these lines, the cerebellum may critically contribute to performance monitoring, a set of cognitive and affective functions underlying adaptive behavior. This review presents and integrates evidence from recent neuroimaging and clinical studies for a cerebellar role in performance monitoring with focus on sensory prediction, error and conflict processing, response inhibition, and feedback learning. Together with evidence for involvement in articulatory monitoring during working memory, these findings suggest monitoring as the cerebellum's overarching function.",

			"abstract": "Neuronal inhibition can be defined as a spatiotemporal restriction or suppression of local microcircuit activity. The importance of inhibition relies in its fundamental role in shaping signal processing in single neurons and neuronal circuits. In this context, the activity of inhibitory interneurons proved the key to endow networks with complex computational and dynamic properties. In the last 50 years, the prevailing view on the functional role of cerebellar cortical inhibitory circuits was that excitatory and inhibitory inputs sum spatially and temporally in order to determine the motor output through Purkinje cells (PCs). Consequently, cerebellar inhibition has traditionally been conceived in terms of restricting or blocking excitation. This assumption has been challenged, in particular in the cerebellar cortex where all neurons except granule cells (and unipolar brush cells in specific lobules) are inhibitory and fire spontaneously at high rates. Recently, a combination of electrophysiological recordings in vitro and in vivo, imaging, optogenetics and computational modeling, has revealed that inhibitory interneurons play a much more complex role in regulating cerebellar microcircuit functions: inhibition shapes neuronal response dynamics in the whole circuit and eventually regulate the PC output. This review elaborates current knowledge on cerebellar inhibitory interneurons [Golgi cells, Lugaro cells (LCs), basket cells (BCs) and stellate cells (SCs)], starting from their ontogenesis and moving up to their morphological, physiological and plastic properties, and integrates this knowledge with that on the more renown granule cells and PCs. We will focus on the circuit loops in which these interneurons are involved and on the way they generate feed-forward, feedback and lateral inhibition along with complex spatio-temporal response dynamics. In this perspective, inhibitory interneurons emerge as the real controllers of cerebellar functioning.",

			"abstract": "Complex actions may arise by combining simple motor primitives. Our studies support individual premotor drive pulses or bursts as execution primitives in spinal cord. Alternatively, the fundamental execution primitives at the segmental level could be time-varying synergies. To distinguish these hypotheses, we examined sensory feedback effects during targeted wiping organized in spinal cord. This behavior comprises three bursts. We tested (1) whether feedback altered the structure of individual premotor drive bursts or primitives, and (2) whether feedback differentially modulated different drive bursts or pulses in the three burst sequence. At least two of the three bursts would need to always be comodulated to support a time-varying synergy. We used selective muscle vibration to control spindle feedback from a single muscle (biceps/iliofibularis). The structures of premotor drive bursts were conserved. However, biceps vibration (1) scaled the amplitudes of two bursts coactivated during the initial phase of wiping independently of one another without altering their phase, and (2) independently phase regulated the third burst but preserved its amplitude. Thus, all three bursts were regulated separately. Durations were unaffected. The independent effects depended on (1) time of vibration during wiping, (2) frequency of vibration, and (3) limb configuration. Because each of the three bursts was independently modulated, these data strongly support execution using individual premotor bursts rather than time-varying synergies at the spinal level of motor organization. Our data show that both sensory feedback and central systems of the spinal cord act in concert to adjust the individual premotor bursts in support of the straight and unimodal wiping trajectory.",

			"abstract": "The functional properties of cerebellar stellate cells and the way they regulate molecular layer activity are still unclear. We have measured stellate cells electroresponsiveness and their activation by parallel fiber bursts. Stellate cells showed intrinsic pacemaking, along with characteristic responses to depolarization and hyperpolarization, and showed a marked short-term facilitation during repetitive parallel fiber transmission. Spikes were emitted after a lag and only at high frequency, making stellate cells to operate as delay-high-pass filters. A detailed computational model summarizing these physiological properties allowed to explore different functional configurations of the parallel fiber—stellate cell—Purkinje cell circuit. Simulations showed that, following parallel fiber stimulation, Purkinje cells almost linearly increased their response with input frequency, but such an increase was inhibited by stellate cells, which leveled the Purkinje cell gain curve to its 4 Hz value. When reciprocal inhibitory connections between stellate cells were activated, the control of stellate cells over Purkinje cell discharge was maintained only at very high frequencies. These simulations thus predict a new role for stellate cells, which could endow the molecular layer with low-pass and band-pass filtering properties regulating Purkinje cell gain and, along with this, also burst delay and the burst-pause responses pattern.",

			"abstract": "This review surveys physiological, behavioral, and morphological evidence converging to the view of the cerebro-cerebellum as loci of internal forward models. The cerebro-cerebellum, the phylogenetically newest expansion in the cerebellum, receives convergent inputs from cortical, subcortical, and spinal sources, and is thought to perform the predictive computation for both motor control, motor learning, and cognitive functions. This predictive computation is known as an internal forward model. First, we elucidate the theoretical foundations of an internal forward model and its role in motor control and motor learning within the framework of the optimal feedback control model. Then, we discuss a neural mechanism that generates various patterns of outputs from the cerebro-cerebellum. Three lines of supporting evidence for the internal-forward-model hypothesis are presented in detail. First, we provide physiological evidence that the cerebellar outputs (activities of dentate nucleus cells) are predictive for the cerebellar inputs [activities of mossy fibers (MFs)]. Second, we provide behavioral evidence that a component of movement kinematics is predictive for target motion in control subjects but lags behind a target motion in patients with cerebellar ataxia. Third, we provide morphological evidence that the cerebellar cortex and the dentate nucleus receive separate MF projections, a prerequisite for optimal estimation. Finally, we speculate that the predictive computation in the cerebro-cerebellum could be deployed to not only motor control but also to non-motor, cognitive functions. This review concludes that the predictive computation of the internal forward model is the unifying algorithmic principle for understanding diverse functions played by the cerebro-cerebellum.",

			"abstract": "The early characterization of the cerebellar cortical microcircuit gave rise to the influential Marr–Albus framework for modelling cerebellar function. This framework has been used in adaptive-filter form in many cerebellar models.However, the initial characterization of the cerebellar microcircuitry in these models was far from complete, and the role of many microcircuit components was left unexplained. Subsequent technical advances have provided extensive new evidence concerning these components and their plasticity.Here the authors relate these advances to recent developments in understanding the computational bases of cerebellar adaptive-filter models, and conclude that there are striking parallels between theory and experiment in the domains of symmetrical long-term potentiation and long-term depression, silent parallel fibre synapses, interneuron plasticity and recurrent mossy fibre connectivity.This convergence encourages further collaboration between empirical and computational approaches in identifying the functional significance of features of the cerebellar microcircuit that are still poorly understood, in particular mossy fibre signalling and granular layer processing, and the nature of climbing fibre signals.",

			"abstract": "Cerebellar function is increasingly discussed in terms of engineering schemes for motor control and signal processing that involve internal models. To address the relation between the cerebellum and internal models, we adopt the chip metaphor that has been used to represent the combination of a homogeneous cerebellar cortical microcircuit with individual microzones having unique external connections. This metaphor indicates that identifying the function of a particular cerebellar chip requires knowledge of both the general microcircuit algorithm and the chip’s individual connections. Here we use a popular candidate algorithm as embodied in the adaptive filter, which learns to decorrelate its inputs from a reference (‘teaching’, ‘error’) signal. This algorithm is computationally powerful enough to be used in a very wide variety of engineering applications. However, the crucial issue is whether the external connectivity required by such applications can be implemented biologically. We argue that some applications appear to be in principle biologically implausible: these include the Smith predictor and Kalman filter (for state estimation), and the feedback–error–learning scheme for adaptive inverse control. However, even for plausible schemes, such as forward models for noise cancellation and novelty-detection, and the recurrent architecture for adaptive inverse control, there is unlikely to be a simple mapping between microzone function and internal model structure. This initial analysis suggests that cerebellar involvement in particular behaviours is therefore unlikely to have a neat classification into categories such as ‘forward model’. It is more likely that cerebellar microzones learn a task-specific adaptive-filter operation which combines a number of signal-processing roles.",

			"abstract": "Many cerebellar models use a form of synaptic plasticity that implements decorrelation learning. Parallel fibers carrying signals positively correlated with climbing-fiber input have their synapses weakened (long-term depression), whereas those carrying signals negatively correlated with climbing input have their synapses strengthened (long-term potentiation). Learning therefore ceases when all parallel-fiber signals have been decorrelated from climbing-fiber input. This is a computationally powerful rule for supervised learning and can be cast in a spike-timing dependent plasticity form for comparison with experimental evidence. Decorrelation learning is particularly well suited to sensory prediction, for example, in the reafference problem where external sensory signals are interfered with by reafferent signals from the organism’s own movements, and the required circuit appears similar to the one found to mediate classical eye blink conditioning. However, for certain stimuli, avoidance is a much better option than simple prediction, and decorrelation learning can also be used to acquire appropriate avoidance movements. One example of a stimulus to be avoided is retinal slip that degrades visual processing, and decorrelation learning appears to play a role in the vestibulo-ocular reflex that stabilizes gaze in the face of unpredicted head movements. Decorrelation learning is thus suitable for both sensory prediction and motor control. It may also be well suited for generic spatial and temporal coordination, because of its ability to remove the unwanted side effects of movement. Finally, because it can be used with any kind of time-varying signal, the cerebellum could play a role in cognitive processing.",

			"abstract": "In general, control of movement is considered to be either cortical, spinal, or purely biomechanical and is studied separately at these levels. To achieve this separation when studying a particular level, variations that may be introduced by the other levels are generally either ignored or restricted. This restriction misrepresents the way movements occur in realistic scenarios and limits the ability to model movements in a biologically inspired manner. In this work, we propose a heuristic model for motor control that conceptually and mathematically accounts for the entire motor process, from target to endpoint. It simulates human arm motion and is able to represent functionally different motion properties by flexibly choosing more or less complex motion paths without built-in optimization or joint constraints. With a novel implementation of hierarchical control, this model successfully overcomes the problem of degrees of freedom in robotics. It can serve as a template for neurocomputational work that currently uses control architectures that do not mirror the human motor control process. The model itself also suggests a maximum threshold for delays in position feedback for effective movement, and that the primary role of position feedback in movement is to overcome the effects of environmental perturbations at the joint level. These findings can inform future efforts to develop biologically inspired motor control techniques for prosthetic devices.",

			"abstract": "In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted to analyze how humans subconsciously optimize various performance criteria while performing a particular task, which has led to the development of robots that are capable of performing tasks with a similar level of efficiency as humans. The complexity of the human body has led researchers to create a framework for robot motion planning to recreate those motions in robotic systems using various redundancy resolution methods. This study conducts a thorough analysis of the relevant literature to provide a detailed exploration of the different redundancy resolution methodologies used in motion generation for mimicking human motion. The studies are investigated and categorized according to the study methodology and various redundancy resolution methods. An examination of the literature revealed a strong trend toward formulating intrinsic strategies that govern human movement through machine learning and artificial intelligence. Subsequently, the paper critically evaluates the existing approaches and highlights their limitations. It also identifies the potential research areas that hold promise for future investigations.",
